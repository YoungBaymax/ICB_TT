	abstract = {To investigate sensitivity and specificity of infrared ear thermometry compared to rectal thermometry to detect fever in children.
Systematic review of studies comparing rectal and infrared ear temperatures in children.
Sensitivity and specificity estimates were highly heterogeneous, and displayed an inverse relationship suggestive of a threshold effect, due in part to the different offsets used to obtain adjusted tympanic temperatures depending on the ear thermometer mode. To account for this threshold effect, results from each study were summarized as a diagnostic odds ratio ({DOR}). These varied extensively across studies, suggesting that heterogeneity between study estimates is not fully explained by the threshold effect. Pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity from random effects models were 63.7\% (95\% {CI} 55.6\%, 71.8\%) and 95.2\% (95\% {CI} 93.5\%, 96.9\%), respectively.
Pooled estimates of measures of diagnostic accuracy from these studies suggest that infrared ear thermometry would fail to diagnose fever in three or four out of every 10 febrile children (with fever defined by a rectal temperature of 38°C or above). These findings support our previous concerns about the use of infrared ear thermometers in situations where a failure to detect fever has serious implications.},

Specific binding of 125I-labelled gastrin I was localised to particles sedimenting between 250--20 000 X g. Saturation of binding sites occurred with a gastrin concentration of 10(-11) M in an assay system containing 0.6--1.7 mg/ml of homogenate protein. Gastrin binding was shown to be reversible, temperature- and {pH}-dependent, and susceptible to tryptic digestion. Electron microscopic and enzymatic studies showed the binding fraction to contain predominantly mitochondria. Preincubation of the homogenate with 10(-8) M cholecystokinin or secretin inhibited gastrin binding to a greater extent than an equimolar concentration of pentagastrin. Cimetidine, a histamine receptor antagonist, did not affect binding of gastrin to the receptor.},

In practice, the main challenge is how to deal with linear acceleration interference and magnetic disturbance which always cause significant attitude-estimation errors. In this paper, we present a novel quaternion-based Kalman filter with vector selection scheme for accurate human body orientation estimation using an inertial/magnetic sensor unit. In the proposed algorithm, the gyroscope measurement is used as an input to construct the linear process equation, and the accelerometer and magnetometer measurements are manipulated to establish the linear pseudomeasurement equation. A linear Kalman filter is then deployed to estimate the body orientation. In the Kalman filter framework, a vector selection scheme is designed to protect the algorithm against undesirable conditions such as temporary intensive movement and magnetic disturbance and enable it to acquire more accurate orientation estimation. The experimental results have shown that the proposed algorithm can provide accurate attitude estimations with regard to the ground truth.},

Contextual variables are introduced to define fuzzy validity domains of each sensor. The algorithm increases the reliability of the position information. A simulation of this algorithm is then made by fusing {GPS} and {IMU} data coming from real tests on a land vehicle. Bad data delivered by {GPS} sensor are detected and rejected using contextual information thus increasing reliability. Moreover, because of a lack of credibility of {GPS} signal in some cases and because of the drift of the {INS}, {GPS}/{INS} association is not satisfactory at the moment. In order to avoid this problem, the authors propose to feed the fusion process based on a multisensor Kalman filter directly with the acceleration provided by the {IMU}. Moreover, the filter developed here gives the possibility to easily add other sensors in order to achieve performances required.},

Using scripted activities of daily living ({ADL}) such as sitting, standing, walking, and numerous postural transitions performed under supervised conditions by young and elderly subjects, the ability to discriminate these {ADL} were investigated using a single tri-axial accelerometer, mounted on the trunk. Data analysis was performed using Matlab® to determine the accelerations performed during eight different {ADL}. Transitions and transition types were detected using the scalar (dot) product technique and vertical velocity estimates on a single tri-axial accelerometer was compared to a proven discrete wavelet transform method that incorporated accelerometers and gyroscopes. Activities and postural transitions were accurately detected by this simplified low-power kinematic sensor and activity detection algorithm with a sensitivity and specificity of 86–92\% for young healthy subjects in a controlled setting and 83–89\% for elderly healthy subjects in a home environment.},

The all-accelerometer {IMU} provides a high resolution but drifting angular velocity estimate, while the magnetic north vector is combined with the estimated gravity vector to yield a non-drifting but noisy orientation estimate. Analysis of the dominant stochastic noise components of the sensors and derivation of the noise covariance are presented. The proposed Kalman filter obtains a non-drifting orientation estimate with improved resolution by incorporating the motion dynamics of the instrument during microsurgery and models the angular velocity drift explicitly as extra dynamic states.},

We employ the observability rank criterion based on Lie derivatives to verify the conditions under which the nonlinear system that describes the process of motion tracking by the {IMU} is observable, namely it may provide sufficient information for performing the estimation task with bounded estimation errors. The observability conditions are that the magnetic field, perturbed by first-order Gauss-Markov magnetic variations, and the gravity vector are not collinear and that the {IMU} is subject to some angular motions.

Optical tracking is one of the most accurate dynamic tracking systems, and is commonly used as diagnosis devices for joint motion analysis. However, these systems are usually located in gait analysis laboratory and not readily available in clinic or hospital for day to day diagnostic use. In order to provide an alternative means for joint kinematics assessment, the following method is examined.

Each node communicates wirelessly to the base station with Bluetooth. A quaternion based Extended Kalman Filter ({EKF}) was implemented to process the data for orientation estimation. Anatomy constraint is applied to the relative orientation of the estimation.

A brain-machine interface ({BMI}) wheelchair control system was constructed by effective signal processing methods, and subjects were trained by a feedback method to decrease the training time and improve accuracy. The implemented system was evaluated through experiments on controlling bars and avoiding obstacles using three subjects. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the feedback training method was evaluated by comparison with an imaginary movement experiment without any visual feedback for two additional subjects. In the bar-controlling experiment, two subjects achieved a 95.00\% success rate, and the third had a 91.66\% success rate. In the obstacle avoidance experiment, all three achieved success rate over 90\% success rate, and required almost the same amount of time to reach as that when driving with a joystick. In the experiment on imaginary movement without visual feedback, the two additional subjects adapted to the experiment far slower than they did with visual feedback. In this study, the feedback training method allowed subjects to easily and rapidly gain accurate control over the implemented wheelchair system.

Also, the variation in the peak temperature rise achieved was compared between patients and between sonications within treatments. On average, the non-perfused area was 1.9±0.7 times as large as the area that achieved a thermal dose of 240 equivalent min at 43°C. The non-perfused area agreed better with a lower threshold; it was 1.2±0.4 times as large as the area that achieved a thermal dose of ≥18 equivalent min at 43°C. Agreement was better for smaller treatments. For large treatments at least, the non-perfused area was clearly enlarged by vascular occlusion to regions within the fibroid that were outside that directly targeted. Variations in the peak temperature rise were as large as a factor of two for similar acoustic parameters, both between patients and within individual treatments.

In the laboratory, subjects walked and ran on a treadmill over a select range of speeds and grades for 3 min each (six stages in random order) while connected to a stationary calorimeter, preceded and followed by brief sitting and standing. On a different day, subjects completed scripted activities in the field connected to a portable calorimeter. The {MSB} was attached to a strap at the right hip. Subjects repeated one condition (randomly selected) on the third day. Accuracy of inferred activities compared with recorded activities (correctly identified activities/total activities × 100) was 97 and 84\% in the laboratory and field, respectively. Absolute accuracy of energy expenditure [100 – absolute value (kilocalories {MSB} – kilocalories calorimeter/kilocalories calorimeter) × 100] was 89 and 76\% in the laboratory and field, the later being different (P {\textless} 0.05) from the calorimeter. Test–retest reliability for energy expenditure was significant in both settings (P {\textless} 0.0001; r = 0.97). In general, the {MSB} provides accurate measures of activity type in laboratory and field settings and energy expenditure during treadmill walking and running although the device underestimates energy expenditure in the field.},

Five equations were conserved according to their accuracy assessed from error rates, interchangeability and correlations analyses: one containing only basic parameters, two containing {VO}2max or speed at {VO}2max and two including running speed with or without {HR}. Equations accuracy was further tested in an independent sample during a 40 min validation test at 50\% of {HR} reserve. It appeared that: (1) the new basic equation was more accurate than pre-existing equations (R-2 0.809 versus. 0,737 respectively); (2) the prediction of {EE} was more accurate with the addition of {VO}2max (R-2 = 0.879); and (3) the equations containing running speed were the most accurate and were considered to have good agreement with indirect calorimetry. In conclusion, {EE} estimation during running might be significantly improved by including running speed in the predictive models, a parameter readily available with treadmill or {GPS}.},

In this paper, we compare loosely and closely coupled integration strategies under realistic racing scenarios when {GPS} is partially or completely masked. The study reveals that both integration approaches have a similar performance when the satellite constellation is completed or the outages are short. However, for less than four satellites, the closely coupled strategy clearly outperforms the loosely coupled approach. The second part of the paper is devoted to the important problem of system initialization, because the conventional {GPS}/{IMU} alignment methods are no longer applicable when using {MEMS}-{IMU}. We introduce a modified coarse alignment method and a quaternion estimation method for the computation of the initial orientation. Simulations and practical experiments reveal that both methods are numerically stable for any initial orientation of the sensors with the error characteristics of {MEMS}-{IMUs}. Throughout the paper, our findings are supported by racing experiments with references provided in both, the measurement and the navigation domains.},

	abstract = {A generic framework for the automated classification of human movements using an accelerometry monitoring system is introduced. The framework was structured around a binary decision tree in which movements were divided into classes and subclasses at different hierarchical levels. General distinctions between movements were applied in the top levels, and successively more detailed subclassifications were made in the lower levels of the tree. The structure was modular and flexible: parts of the tree could be reordered, pruned or extended, without the remainder of the tree being affected. This framework was used to develop a classifier to identify basic movements from the signals obtained from a single, waist-mounted triaxial accelerometer. The movements were first divided into activity and rest. The activities were classified as falls, walking, transition between postural orientations, or other movement. The postural orientations during rest were classified as sitting, standing or lying. In controlled laboratory studies in which 26 normal, healthy subjects carried out a set of basic movements, the sensitivity of every classification exceeded 87\%, and the specificity exceeded 94\%; the overall accuracy of the system, measured as the number of correct classifications across all levels of the hierarchy, was a sensitivity of 97.7\% and a specificity of 98.7\% over a data set of 1309 movements.},

However, the drift of {IMUs} results in significant accumulated errors for long-term position and orientation measurement. This paper reports a method to compensate the drift of inertial sensors with the assist of ultrasonic sensors and magnetometers. The magnetometer is combined with a three-axis accelerometer as a digital compass for orientation determination in static state by measuring the gravity and the earth's magnetic field vectors. A three-axis gyroscope is used to measure the orientation in dynamic state to complement the digital compass. Displacement determination is implemented using the accelerometer through double integration, and an ultrasonic sensor is employed to periodically calibrate the accumulated errors of the accelerometer. The redundant data from the multi-sensors are fused using extended Kalman filter ({EKF}), in which the position measured by the ultrasonic sensor and the orientation measured by the digital compass are defined as the observation values, and the position, velocity, and orientation are included in the state vector. Experimental results show that the accumulated errors of inertial sensors are reduced by ultrasonic sensors and magnetometers, and {EKF} improves the accuracy of orientation and position measurements.},

Here, a model was developed using the detected type of physical activity ({PA}) and movement intensity ({MI}), based on a tri-axial seismic accelerometer ({DynaPort} {MiniMod}; {McRoberts} B.V., The Hague, the Netherlands), with energy expenditure for {PA} as a reference. The relation between {AEE} (J/min/kg), {MI}, and the type of {PA} was determined for standardized {PAs} as performed in a laboratory including: lying, sitting, standing, and walking. {AEE} (J/min/kg) was calculated from total energy expenditure ({TEE}) and sleeping metabolic rate ({SMR}) as assessed with indirect calorimetry (({TEE} × 0.9) - {SMR}). Subsequently, the model was validated over 23-h intervals in a respiration chamber. Subjects were 15 healthy women (age: 22 ± 2 years; {BMI}: 24.0 ± 4.0 kg/m2). Predicted {AEE} in the chamber was significantly related to measured {AEE} both within (r2 = 0.81 ± 0.06, P {\textless} 0.00001) and between (r2 = 0.70, P {\textless} 0.001) subjects. The explained variation in {AEE} by the model was higher than the explained variation by {MI} alone. This shows that a tri-axial seismic accelerometer is a valid tool for estimating {AEE} under sedentary conditions.},

Our method uses a classifier for activity recognition constructed with machine learning. Attention was paid to the complexity of the attributes for machine learning, resulting in the omission of the most complex attributes in order to prolong the battery life. The recognized activity serves as an input to a classifier for energy expenditure estimation, which was also constructed with machine learning.

The neurobiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we examine reinforcement learning and sensitivity to both reward and punishment outcomes in hypomania-prone individuals not receiving pharmacotherapy.{MethodWe} recorded {EEG} from 45 healthy individuals split into three groups by low, intermediate and high self-reported hypomanic traits. Participants played a computerised card game in which they learned the reward contingencies of three cues. Neural responses to monetary gain and loss were measured using the feedback-related negativity ({FRN}), a component implicated in motivational outcome evaluation and reinforcement learning.{ResultsAs} predicted, rewards elicited a smaller {FRN} in the hypomania-prone group relative to the low hypomania group, indicative of greater reward responsiveness. The hypomania-prone group also showed smaller {FRN} to losses, indicating diminished response to negative feedback.{ConclusionOur} findings indicate that proneness to hypomania is associated with both reward hypersensitivity and discounting of punishment. This positive evaluation bias may be driven by aberrant reinforcement learning signals, which fail to update future expectations. This provides a possible neural mechanism explaining risk-taking and impaired reinforcement learning in {BD}. Further research will be needed to explore the potential value of the {FRN} as a biological vulnerability marker for mania and pathological risk-taking.},

This method is based on water saturation shift referencing ({WASSR}), a method first developed for assessing B0 field inhomogeneity. Temperature-induced water {PRF} shifts were determined by estimating the frequency of the minimum intensity of the water direct saturation spectrum at each temperature using Lorentzian line-shape fitting. The change in temperature was then calculated from the difference in water {PRF} shifts between temperatures. Optimal acquisition parameters were first estimated using simulations and later confirmed experimentally. Results in vitro and in vivo showed that the temperature changes measured using the temperature-responsive {WASSR} (T-{WASSR}) were in good agreement with those obtained with {MR} spectroscopy or phase-mapping-based water {PRF} measurement methods,. In addition, the feasibility of temperature mapping in fat-containing tissue is demonstrated in vitro.

	abstract = {Based on a cascaded Kalman–Particle Filtering, gyroscope drift and robot attitude estimation method is proposed in this paper. Due to noisy and erroneous measurements of {MEMS} gyroscope, it is combined with Photogrammetry based vision navigation scenario. Quaternions kinematics and robot angular velocity dynamics with augmented drift dynamics of gyroscope are employed as system state space model. Nonlinear attitude kinematics, drift and robot angular movement dynamics each in 3 dimensions result in a nonlinear high dimensional system. To reduce the complexity, we propose a decomposition of system to cascaded subsystems and then design separate cascaded observers. This design leads to an easier tuning and more precise debugging from the perspective of programming and such a setting is well suited for a cooperative modular system with noticeably reduced computation time. Kalman Filtering ({KF}) is employed for the linear and Gaussian subsystem consisting of angular velocity and drift dynamics together with gyroscope measurement. The estimated angular velocity is utilized as input of the second Particle Filtering ({PF}) based observer in two scenarios of stochastic and deterministic inputs. Simulation results are provided to show the efficiency of the proposed method. Moreover, the experimental results based on data from a 3D {MEMS} {IMU} and a 3D camera system are used to demonstrate the efficiency of the method.},

	abstract = {For many years people have speculated that electroencephalographic activity or other electrophysiological measures of brain function might provide a new non-muscular channel for sending messages and commands to the external world – a brain–computer interface ({BCI}). Over the past 15 years, productive {BCI} research programs have arisen. Encouraged by new understanding of brain function, by the advent of powerful low-cost computer equipment, and by growing recognition of the needs and potentials of people with disabilities, these programs concentrate on developing new augmentative communication and control technology for those with severe neuromuscular disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brainstem stroke, and spinal cord injury. The immediate goal is to provide these users, who may be completely paralyzed, or ‘locked in’, with basic communication capabilities so that they can express their wishes to caregivers or even operate word processing programs or neuroprostheses. Present-day {BCIs} determine the intent of the user from a variety of different electrophysiological signals. These signals include slow cortical potentials, P300 potentials, and mu or beta rhythms recorded from the scalp, and cortical neuronal activity recorded by implanted electrodes. They are translated in real-time into commands that operate a computer display or other device. Successful operation requires that the user encode commands in these signals and that the {BCI} derive the commands from the signals. Thus, the user and the {BCI} system need to adapt to each other both initially and continually so as to ensure stable performance.

Future progress will depend on: recognition that {BCI} research and development is an interdisciplinary problem, involving neurobiology, psychology, engineering, mathematics, and computer science; identification of those signals, whether evoked potentials, spontaneous rhythms, or neuronal firing rates, that users are best able to control independent of activity in conventional motor output pathways; development of training methods for helping users to gain and maintain that control; delineation of the best algorithms for translating these signals into device commands; attention to the identification and elimination of artifacts such as electromyographic and electro-oculographic activity; adoption of precise and objective procedures for evaluating {BCI} performance; recognition of the need for long-term as well as short-term assessment of {BCI} performance; identification of appropriate {BCI} applications and appropriate matching of applications and users; and attention to factors that affect user acceptance of augmentative technology, including ease of use, cosmesis, and provision of those communication and control capacities that are most important to the user. Development of {BCI} technology will also benefit from greater emphasis on peer-reviewed research publications and avoidance of the hyperbolic and often misleading media attention that tends to generate unrealistic expectations in the public and skepticism in other researchers.

	abstract = {We present a non-invasive {MRI} approach for assessing the water proton resonance frequency ({PRF}) shifts associated with changes in temperature. This method is based on water saturation shift referencing ({WASSR}), a method first developed for assessing B-0 field inhomogeneity. Temperature-induced water {PRF} shifts were determined by estimating the frequency of the minimum intensity of the water direct saturation spectrum at each temperature using Lorentzian line-shape fitting. The change in temperature was then calculated from the difference in water {PRF} shifts between temperatures. Optimal acquisition parameters were first estimated using simulations and later confirmed experimentally. Results in vitro and in vivo showed that the temperature changes measured using the temperature-responsive {WASSR} (T-{WASSR}) were in good agreement with those obtained with {MR} spectroscopy or phase-mapping-based water {PRF} measurement methods,. In addition, the feasibility of temperature mapping in fat-containing tissue is demonstrated in vitro. In conclusion, the T-{WASSR} approach provides an alternative for non-invasive temperature mapping by {MRI}, especially suitable for temperature measurements in fat-containing tissues.

The attitude of the airship was determined using micro-electromechanical sensors ({MEMS}) gyros with feedback from the earth's magnetic field and gravity vectors. {MEMS} accelerometer measurements were used as a gravity vector, as the dynamic accelerations on an airship are small compared with the static gravitational acceleration. The velocity and position estimates were updated from a loosely integrated {GPS} receiver. It was found that the best trade-off between accuracy and processing power could be achieved by having two smaller extended Kalman filters ({EKF}) running in sequence. The first {EKF} estimates the attitude of the airship, while the second {EKF} estimates the velocity and position of the airship.

Objective: To test the hypothesis that increased gait variability predicts falls among community-living older adults attending an outpatient clinic. Design: Prospective, cohort study. Setting: Three outpatient geriatric clinics. Participants: Fifty-two community-living, ambulatory men and women aged ≥ 70 years. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Subjects walked at a normal pace for up to 6 minutes wearing force-sensitive insoles that measured the gait rhythm on a stride-to-stride basis. Afterward, subjects reported fall status on a weekly basis for 1 year. The primary outcomes were the association between measures of the stride-to-stride fluctuations in gait rhythm and (1) subsequent falls during a 12-month follow-up period and (2) potential contributing factors. Results: Almost 40\% of the subjects reported falling during the 12-month follow-up period. Stride time variability was 106 ± 30ms in subjects who subsequently fell (n = 20) and 49 ± 4ms in those who did not experience a fall (n = 32) during the 12-month follow-up period (p {\textless}.04). Logistic regression also showed that stride time variability predicted falls (p {\textless}.05). Stride time variability correlated significantly with multiple factors including strength, balance, gait speed, functional status, and even mental health, but these other measures did not discriminate future fallers from nonfallers. Conclusions: These findings show both the feasibility of obtaining stride-to-stride measures of gait timing in the ambulatory setting and the potential use of gait variability measures in augmenting the prospective evaluation of fall risk in community-living older adults. © 2001 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation},

Walking is the most common everyday life activity and walking speed can be used as an indicator for human physical activity profile.

We propose an algorithm, which predicts the gait speed based on body accelerations measured on the right side hip by a tri-axial accelerometer. Based on the gait speed the activity is classified and the energy expenditure is estimated.

The performance of these algorithms occasionally destabilize during human motion tracking activities, which does not satisfy the reliability and high accuracy demand in biomedical application. A previous study accessed the feasibility of using semiconductor based inertial measurement units ({IMUs}) for human motion tracking. {IMU} hardware has been redesigned and an attitude estimation algorithm using sequential Monte Carlo ({SMC}) methods, or particle filter, for quaternions was developed.

	abstract = {In the quest for quality, software developers have long focused on improving the internal architecture of their products. Larry L. Constantine--who originally created structured design to effect such improvement--now joins with well-known consultant Lucy A. D. Lockwood to turn the focus of software development to the external architecture. In this book, they present the models and methods of a revolutionary approach to software that will help programmers deliver more usable software--software that will enable users to accomplish their tasks with greater ease and efficiency.   Recognizing usability as the key to successful software, Constantine and Lockwood provide concrete tools and techniques that programmers can employ to meet that end. Much more than just another set of rules for good user-interface design, this book guides readers through a systematic software development process. This process, called usage-centered design, weaves together two major threads in software development methods: use cases (also used with {UML}) and essential modeling. With numerous examples and case studies of both conventional and specialized software applications, the authors illustrate what has been shown in practice to work and what has proved to be of greatest practical value.   Highlights     Presents a streamlined process for developing highly usable software   Describes practical methods and models successfully implemented in industry   Complements modern development practices, including the Unified Process and other object-oriented software engineering approaches},

These body parameters together with the {DK} module allow us to map human hand trajectories into the joint space of the robot, where a standard {PID} control is implemented. Overall our strategy is able to transfer motion skills from human to a given robot by means of an online inertial sensor-guided motion control. Moreover, our method can be used for robot teleoperation applications in a master-slave configuration, with a human interface based on inertial sensors.

	abstract = {The assumption that working on board ship is more strenuous than comparable work ashore was investigated in this study. Various physiological parameters (V˙O2, V˙{CO}2, V˙ E and {HR}) have been measured to determine the energy expenditure of subjects walking slowly on a moving platform (ship motion simulator). Twelve subjects (eight men and four women) walked either freely on the floor or on a treadmill at a speed of 1 m · s−1. Platform motion was either in a heave, pitch or roll mode. These three conditions were compared with a control condition in which the platform remained stationary. The results showed that during pitch and roll movements of the platform, the energy expenditure for the same walking task was about 30\% higher than under the stationary control condition (3.6 J · kg−1 · m−1 vs 2.5 J · kg−1 · m−1, P {\textless} 0.05) for both walking on a treadmill and free walking. The heart rate data supported the higher energy expenditure results with an elevation of the heart rate (112 beats · min−1 vs 103 beats · min−1, P {\textless} 0.05). The heave condition did not differ significantly from the stationary control condition. Pitch and roll were not significantly different from each other. During all experimental conditions free walking resulted in a higher energy cost of walking than treadmill walking (3.5 J · kg−1 · m−1 vs 2.7 J · kg−1 · m−1, P {\textless} 0.05) at the same average speed. The results of this experiment were interpreted as indicating that the muscular effort, needed for maintaining balance when walking on a pitching or rolling platform, resulted in a significantly higher work load than similar walking on a stable or a heaving floor, independent of the mode of walking. These results explain in part the increased fatigue observed when a task is performed on a moving platform.},

This method is based on water saturation shift referencing ({WASSR}), a method first developed for assessing B-0 field inhomogeneity. Temperature-induced water {PRF} shifts were determined by estimating the frequency of the minimum intensity of the water direct saturation spectrum at each temperature using Lorentzian line-shape fitting. The change in temperature was then calculated from the difference in water {PRF} shifts between temperatures. Optimal acquisition parameters were first estimated using simulations and later confirmed experimentally. Results in vitro and in vivo showed that the temperature changes measured using the temperature-responsive {WASSR} (T-{WASSR}) were in good agreement with those obtained with {MR} spectroscopy or phase-mapping-based water {PRF} measurement methods,. In addition, the feasibility of temperature mapping in fat-containing tissue is demonstrated in vitro. In conclusion, the T-{WASSR} approach provides an alternative for non-invasive temperature mapping by {MRI}, especially suitable for temperature measurements in fat-containing tissues.

Previous studies have established the ability of wearable miniature inertial sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes) to automatically detect falls, for the purpose of delivering medical assistance. In the current study, we extend the applications of this technology, by developing and evaluating the accuracy of wearable sensor systems for determining the cause of falls. Twelve young adults participated in experimental trials involving falls due to seven causes: slips, trips, fainting, and incorrect shifting/transfer of body weight while sitting down, standing up from sitting, reaching and turning. Features (means and variances) of acceleration data acquired from four tri-axial accelerometers during the falling trials were input to a linear discriminant analysis technique. Data from an array of three sensors (left ankle + right ankle + sternum) provided at least 83\% sensitivity and 89\% specificity in classifying falls due to slips, trips, and incorrect shift of body weight during sitting, reaching and turning. Classification of falls due to fainting and incorrect shift during rising was less successful across all sensor combinations. Furthermore, similar classification accuracy was observed with data from wearable sensors and a video-based motion analysis system. These results establish a basis for the development of sensor-based fall monitoring systems that provide information on the cause and circumstances of falls, to direct fall prevention strategies at a patient or population level.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel quaternion Kalman filter ({NQKF}) approach for in-motion alignment of vehicular strapdown inertial attitude reference system using dead-reckoning measurements of inertial measurement unit ({IMU}) and odometer. Unlike several current techniques, the proposed method eliminates usual linearization procedure of the filtering model and is effective with any initial estimation error. Involving transformation of {IMU} data and velocity measurement into inertially fixed axes, a set of vector measurements which is defined as the integral of gravitational vector could be constructed simultaneously in body inertial frame and navigation inertial frame from the {SINS} specific force equation. The {INS} in-motion alignment is heuristically established as initial attitude determination problem from vector observations. A novel linear quaternion pseudo-measurement model is employed in this paper, because the kinematics equation of quaternion is linear, the combination of the two yields a linear {KF} for attitude-quaternion estimation using vector measurements. A recursive algorithm for position estimation previous to alignment accomplishment is deduced based on the formula of integration by parts. The calculation result is applied as the position reference in attitude alignment process to diminish gravity deflection. The presented algorithm is verified through experimental data collected from 7500s vehicular test. The in-motion heading alignment accuracy reaches 4' at around 430s and positioning accuracy is about 0.02\% of the running distance.},

This special type of multivariate time series data is relevant in many research fields including medicine, sports and animation. Key tasks in working with motion data include analysis of motion states and transitions, and synthesis of motion vectors by interpolation and combination. In the practice of research and application of human motion data, challenges exist in providing visual summaries and drill-down functionality for handling large motion data collections. We find that this domain can benefit from appropriate visual retrieval and analysis support to handle these tasks in presence of large motion data. To address this need, we developed {MotionExplorer} together with domain experts as an exploratory search system based on interactive aggregation and visualization of motion states as a basis for data navigation, exploration, and search. Based on an overview-first type visualization, users are able to search for interesting sub-sequences of motion based on a query-by-example metaphor, and explore search results by details on demand. We developed {MotionExplorer} in close collaboration with the targeted users who are researchers working on human motion synthesis and analysis, including a summative field study. Additionally, we conducted a laboratory design study to substantially improve {MotionExplorer} towards an intuitive, usable and robust design. {MotionExplorer} enables the search in human motion capture data with only a few mouse clicks.

Here we apply traditional method agreement and suggest a novel method of functional data analysis to compare motion capture with {IMUs} placed over the fetlock joint in seven horses. We demonstrate acceptable accuracy and precision at less than or equal to 5\% of the range of motion for detection of distal limb mounted cranio-caudal and vertical position. We do not recommend the use of the latero-medial position estimate of the distal metacarpus/metatarsus during walk where the average error is 10\% and the maximum error 111\% of the range.

Detailed activity of the user's hand and arm is acquired via a novel device, called the {BioSleeve}, which packages dry-contact surface electromyography ({EMG}) and an inertial measurement unit ({IMU}) into a sleeve worn on the forearm. The {BioSleeve}'s accompanying algorithms can reliably decode as many as sixteen discrete hand gestures and estimate the continuous orientation of the forearm. These gestures and positions are mapped to robot commands that, to varying degrees, integrate with the robot's perception of its environment and its ability to complete tasks autonomously. This flexible approach enables, for example, supervisory point-to-goal commands, virtual joystick for guarded teleoperation, and high degree of freedom mimicked manipulation, all from a single device. The {BioSleeve} is meant for portable field use; unlike other gesture recognition systems, use of the {BioSleeve} for robot control is invariant to lighting conditions, occlusions, and the human-robot spatial relationship and does not encumber the user's hands. The {BioSleeve} control approach has been implemented on three robot types, and we present proof-of-principle demonstrations with mobile ground robots, manipulation robots, and prosthetic hands.},

	abstract = {Minimally invasive thermal therapy as local treatment of benign and malignant diseases has received increasing interest in recent years. Safety and efficacy of the treatment require accurate temperature measurement throughout the thermal procedure. Noninvasive temperature monitoring is feasible with magnetic resonance ({MR}) imaging based on temperature sensitive {MR} parameters such as the proton resonance frequency ({PRF}), the diffusion coefficient (D), T1 and T2 relaxation times, magnetization transfer, the proton density, as well as temperature sensitive contrast agents. In this paper, the principles of temperature measurements with these methods will be reviewed and their usefulness for monitoring in vivo procedures will be discussed. Whereas most measurements give a temperature change relative to a baseline condition, temperature sensitive contrast agents and spectroscopic imaging can provide absolute temperature measurements. The excellent linearity and temperature dependence of the {PRF} and its near independence of tissue type have made {PRF} based phase mapping methods the preferred choice for many in vivo applications. Accelerated {MRI} imaging techniques for real-time monitoring with the {PRF} method will be discussed. Special attention is paid to acquisition and reconstruction methods for reducing temperature measurement artifacts introduced by tissue motion, which is often unavoidable during in vivo applications.},

	abstract = {Electromyography ({EMG}) has been widely used as control commands for prosthesis, powered exoskeletons and rehabilitative robots. In this paper, an {EMG}-driven state space model is developed to estimate continuous joint angular displacement and velocity, demonstrated by elbow flexion/ extension. The model combines the Hill-based muscle model with the forward dynamics of joint movement, in which kinematic variables are expressed as a function of neural activation levels. {EMG} features including integral of absolute value and waveform length are then extracted, and two quadratic equations which associate the kinematic variables with {EMG} features are constructed to represent the measurement equation. The proposed model are verified by extensively experiments, where the angular movements of human elbow joint are estimated only using the {EMG} signals, and the estimations are compared with the {IMU} measurements to validate the accuracy. As a demonstration, a robotic arm is commanded to follow the human elbow movement estimated by the proposed model, which shows the possibility of {EMG}-based robotic assisted rehabilitation.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was the fine tuning of a Kalman filter with the intent to provide optimal estimates of lower trunk orientation in the frontal and sagittal planes during treadmill walking at different speeds using measured linear acceleration and angular velocity components represented in a local system of reference.
Data were simultaneously collected using both an inertial measurement unit ({IMU}) and a stereophotogrammetric system from three healthy subjects walking on a treadmill at natural, slow and fast speeds. These data were used to estimate the parameters of the Kalman filter that minimized the difference between the trunk orientations provided by the filter and those obtained through stereophotogrammetry. The optimized parameters were then used to process the data collected from a further 15 healthy subjects of both genders and different anthropometry performing the same walking tasks with the aim of determining the robustness of the filter set up.
The filter proved to be very robust. The root mean square values of the differences between the angles estimated through the {IMU} and through stereophotogrammetry were lower than 1.0° and the correlation coefficients between the corresponding curves were greater than 0.91.
The proposed filter design can be used to reliably estimate trunk lateral and frontal bending during walking from inertial sensor data. Further studies are needed to determine the filter parameters that are most suitable for other motor tasks.},

	abstract = {Background The current guidelines for aerobic activity require that adults carry out ≥150 min/week of moderate-intensity physical activity, with a large body of epidemiological evidence showing this level of activity to decrease the incidence of many chronic diseases. Less is known about whether light-intensity activities also have such benefits, and whether sedentary behaviour is an independent predictor of increased risks of these chronic diseases, as imprecise assessments of these behaviours and cross-sectional study designs have limited knowledge to date.
Methods Recent technological advances in assessment methods have made the use of movement sensors, such as the accelerometer, feasible for use in longitudinal, large-scale epidemiological studies. Several such studies are collecting sensor-assessed, objective measures of physical activity with the aim of relating these to the development of clinical endpoints. This is a relatively new area of research; thus, in this article, we use the Women's Health Study ({WHS}) as a case study to illustrate the challenges related to data collection, data processing and analyses of the vast amount of data collected.
Results The {WHS} plans to collect 7 days of accelerometer-assessed physical activity and sedentary behaviour in ∼18 000 women aged ≥62 years. Several logistical challenges exist in collecting data; nonetheless, as of 31 August 2013, 11 590 women have already provided some data. In addition, the {WHS} experience on data reduction and data analyses can help inform other similar large-scale epidemiological studies.
Conclusions Important data on the health effects of light-intensity activity and sedentary behaviour will emerge from large-scale epidemiological studies collecting objective assessments of these behaviours.},

	abstract = {Three-dimensional measurement of joint motion is a promising tool for clinical evaluation and therapeutic treatment comparisons. Although many devices exist for joints kinematics assessment, there is a need for a system that could be used in routine practice. Such a system should be accurate, ambulatory, and easy to use. The combination of gyroscopes and accelerometers (i.e., inertial measurement unit) has proven to be suitable for unrestrained measurement of orientation during a short period of time (i.e., few minutes). However, due to their inability to detect horizontal reference, inertial-based systems generally fail to measure differential orientation, a prerequisite for computing the three-dimentional knee joint angle recommended by the Internal Society of Biomechanics ({ISB}). A simple method based on a leg movement is proposed here to align two inertial measurement units fixed on the thigh and shank segments. Based on the combination of the former alignment and a fusion algorithm, the three-dimensional knee joint angle is measured and compared with a magnetic motion capture system during walking. The proposed system is suitable to measure the absolute knee flexion/extension and abduction/adduction angles with mean ({SD}) offset errors of −1° (1°) and 0° (0.6°) and mean ({SD}) root mean square ({RMS}) errors of 1.5° (0.4°) and 1.7° (0.5°). The system is also suitable for the relative measurement of knee internal/external rotation (mean ({SD}) offset error of 3.4° (2.7°)) with a mean ({SD}) {RMS} error of 1.6° (0.5°). The method described in this paper can be easily adapted in order to measure other joint angular displacements such as elbow or ankle.},

This paper considers the subproblem of using integrated inertial and magnetic sensing to track the attitude (orientation) of surgical instruments. In this scenario, it is usually assumed that the sensor is quasi-static and the surrounding magnetic field is steady. For practical hand-held surgical instruments, perturbations exist due to intended and unintended (e.g., tremor) motion and due to distortion of the surrounding magnetic field. We consider the problem of estimating the gravity and magnetic field in the inertial sensor frame with small perturbations. The dynamics of the gravity and magnetic field is studied under perturbations, their relationships to gyroscope measurements are analyzed, and Kalman filters ({KFs}) are formulated to reduce these perturbations. The estimated gravity and magnetic values (outputs of the {KFs}) are subsequently used in an extended {KF} for attitude estimation. In this filter, the prediction model is given by the system dynamics, formulated using quaternions, and the observation model is given by vector analysis of the estimated gravity and magnetic field. Experiments are performed to validate the algorithms under clinically realistic motions. The complete system demonstrates an improvement in the accuracy of the attitude estimate in the presence of small perturbations, and satisfies the specified accuracy requirement of 1°.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a novel algorithm for estimating energy expenditure during physical activity. The estimation is based on acceleration data measured from a wrist-worn accelerometer. Simultaneous measurements of acceleration and oxygen consumption using a biaxial accelerometer and a breath gas analyzer were made during four different activities: walking, running, Nordic walking and bicycling. A variance feature is used to compress the original acceleration signals. A linear mixed model is fitted to the data to estimate oxygen consumption based on the acceleration data. Lagged values of acceleration are used to take the delayed effect of physical activity on oxygen consumption into consideration. The algorithm also uses information on the height of the subjects. Oxygen consumption is estimated at 15-second intervals and energy expenditure is directly calculated from the oxygen consumption. Based on the experimental data gathered from 10 subjects, a new algorithm for estimating energy expenditure is suggested. It is shown that the method estimates energy expenditure very accurately. In walking, running and Nordic walking the model underestimates energy expenditure by 13, 2 and 9 percent, respectively, and in bicycling energy expenditure is overestimated by 7 percent. Thus, the new approach is a very promising method for estimating energy expenditure.},

	volume = {14},

	abstract = {Increasing concentrations of chloride were found to increase the resolution between two visible absorbance spectral transitions associated with acidification of ferricytochrome c. Analysis of a variety of spectral and viscosity measurements indicates that protonation of a single group having an apparent {pK} of 2.1 +/- 0.2 and an intrinsic {pK} of about 5.3 displaces the methionine ligand without significantly perturbing the native globular conformation. Analysis of methylated ferricytochrome c suggests that protonation of a carboxylate ion, most likely a heme propionate residue, is responsible for displacement of the methionine ligand. Addition of a proton to a second group having an apparent {pK} of 1.2 +/- 0.1 displaces the histidine ligand and unfolds the protein from a globular conformation into a random coil. It is most likely that the second protonation occurs on the imidazole ring of the histidine ligand itself. Chloride is proposed to perturb these transitions by ligation in the fifth coordination position of the heme ion. Such ligation stabilizes a globular conformation of ferricytochrome c at {pH} 0.0 and 25 degrees.},

	abstract = {The Hypersonic Cruise Vehicles ({HCVs}) have an extremely high requirement for the navigation system to be high-reliable, high-autonomic and high-accurate. This paper proposed a method to calibrate the deterministic errors of the Inertial Measurement Unit ({IMU}) of the Inertial Navigation System ({INS}) dynamically. Including the installation errors and the scale factor errors of the {IMU}, an augmented error model of the {IMU} and the navigation parameter error propagation equations of {INS} are discussed first. Then a method based on the Kalman Filter is designed to calibrate deterministic errors of the {IMU} during the {HCVʼs} high dynamic flight process. The proposed method can accurately and dynamically calibrate the deterministic errors of the {IMU}. The calibration results are used to correct the {IMU} deterministic errors and the {INS} parameter errors dynamically. Simulation is made to verify the performance of the calibration method proposed by this paper. The simulation results show that the dynamic calibration method can effectively estimate the installation errors and the scale factor errors of the {IMU}; the precision of the {INS} is improved after the compensation of the installation errors and the scale factor errors that obtained by the calibration method.},

One of the most interesting features of a robot-mediated therapy is the ability to quantify the performance of the rehabilitation tasks proposed to the patient. Although the shoulder is the most complex joint in the body, both for the range of freedom of movements and for the muscular-tendon structure, not so many commercial or research devices have been proposed to study its movements and no study have proposed a standardized, quantitative kinematic and electromyographic assessment. This study aimed to develop a quantitative assessment of kinematics and electromyographic pattern of the arm's muscles involved in reaching robot-assisted movements by means of indices effectively describing the main pattern features in ten normal subjects. Each subject underwent a specific eight sequences motor task protocol. The system automatically classify each movement detecting its start/end times, extract main kinematic indexes plotting activation and deactivation graphs related to eight emg channels. Results showed that particularly movement smoothness indexes and timing of emg patterns may provide an effective upper arm reaching movement assessment.},

In contrast, by using modern {MEMS} (or of similar class) sensors, hardware costs, size and mass can be reduced substantially. However, low-cost sensors often suffer from inaccuracy and are influenced greatly by temperature variation. In this work, such inaccuracies and dependence on temperature variations have been studied, modelled and compensated in order to reach an adequate quality of measurements for the estimation of attitudes. This has been done applying a Kaiman Filter-based sensor fusion algorithm that combines sensor models, error parameters and estimation scheme. Attitude estimation from low-cost sensors is first realized in a Matlab/Simulink platform and then implemented on hardware by programming the micro controller and validated. The accuracies of the estimated roll and pitch attitudes are well within the stipulated accuracy level of ±5‡ for the {ALEX}. However, the estimation of heading, which is mainly derived from the magnetometer readings, seems to be influenced greatly by the variation in local magnetic field},

This method is based on water saturation shift referencing ({WASSR}), a method first developed for assessing B0 field inhomogeneity. Temperature-induced water {PRF} shifts were determined by estimating the frequency of the minimum intensity of the water direct saturation spectrum at each temperature using Lorentzian line-shape fitting. The change in temperature was then calculated from the difference in water {PRF} shifts between temperatures. Optimal acquisition parameters were first estimated using simulations and later confirmed experimentally. Results in vitro and in vivo showed that the temperature changes measured using the temperature-responsive {WASSR} (T-{WASSR}) were in good agreement with those obtained with {MR} spectroscopy or phase-mapping-based water {PRF} measurement methods,. In addition, the feasibility of temperature mapping in fat-containing tissue is demonstrated in vitro. In conclusion, the T-{WASSR} approach provides an alternative for non-invasive temperature mapping by {MRI}, especially suitable for temperature measurements in fat-containing tissues.

In this paper, we propose a novel {EMG}-{IMU} based mouse controller that controls cursor movements based on {IMU} signals. The displacement of the cursor is determined by integrating the acceleration signal from the {IMU}, which moves with the operator's arm. The mouse operations such as left click, right click and wheel scroll, are commanded through {EMG} signals. The pattern recognition algorithm, Linear Discriminant Analysis ({LDA}), is adopted to classify the {EMG} data into several clusters, which correspond to the pre-defined mouse operations. Experimental results have indicated that the proposed mouse controller can achieve an accuracy of 88\%.},

	abstract = {Periodic Limb Movements during Sleep ({PLMS}) can cause significant disturbance to sleep, resulting in daytime sleepiness and reduced quality of life. In conventional clinical practice, {PLMS} are measured using overnight electromyogram ({EMG}) of the tibialis anterior muscle, although historically they have also been measured using piezo-electric gauges placed over the muscle. However, {PLMS} counts ({PLM} index) do not correlate well with clinical symptomology. In this study, we propose that because {EMG} and piezo derived signals measure muscle activation rather than actual movement, they may count events with no appreciable movement of the limb and therefore no contribution to sleep disturbance. The aim of this study is thus to determine the percentage of clinically scored limb movements which are not associated with movement of the great toe measured using accelerometry. 9 participants were studied simultaneously with an overnight diagnostic polysomnogram (including {EMG} and piezo instrumentation of the right leg) and high temporal resolution accelerometry of the right great toe. Limb movements were scored, and peak acceleration during each scored movement was quantified. Across the participant population, 54.9\% (range: 26.7-76.3) and 39.0\% (range: 4.8-69.6) of limb movements scored using piezo and {EMG} instrumentation respectively, were not associated with toe movement measured with accelerometry. If sleep disturbance is the consequence of the limb movements, these results may explain why conventional piezo or {EMG} derived {PLMI} is poorly correlated with clinical symptomology.},

This chapter reviews the intrinsic {MR} parameters that display a temperature sensitivity: the proton resonance frequency ({PRF}), the diffusion coefficient, T 1 and T 2 relaxation times, magnetization transfer, and the proton density. The principles of temperature measurements with these parameters are reviewed and their usefulness for monitoring in vivo procedures is discussed. The excellent linearity and temperature dependence of the {PRF} and its near independence with regard to tissue type have made {PRF}-based phase mapping methods the preferred choice for many in vivo applications. Accelerated {MRI} techniques for real-time monitoring with the {PRF} method are discussed. Special attention is paid to acquisition and reconstruction methods for reducing temperature measurement artifacts introduced by tissue motion, which is often unavoidable during in vivo applications.},

A detailed discussion is provided with respect to different filter state formulations, stance still detection mechanisms and associated filter parameters. The presented pure inertial system is augmented with magnetic field measurements for heading correction. The challenging localization scenario with an elevator is addressed by augmenting the system with a barometric pressure sensor for height error correction.

	abstract = {The proposed strap-down integration method exploits the cyclical nature of human gait: during the gait swing phase, the quaternion-based attitude representation is integrated using a gyroscope from initial conditions that are determined during stance by an accelerometer. Positioning requires double time integration of the gravity-compensated accelerometer signals during swing. An interpolation technique applied to attitude quaternions was developed to improve the accuracy of orientation and positioning estimates by accounting for the effect of sensor bias and scale factor drifts. A simulation environment was developed for the analysis and testing of the proposed algorithm on a synthetic movement trajectory. The aim was to define the true attitude and positioning used in the computation of estimation errors. By thermal modelling, the changes of bias and scale factor of the inertial sensors, calibrated at a single reference temperature, were analysed over a range of ±10°C, for measurement noise standard deviations up to σg = 2.5° s−1 (gyroscope) and σa = 0.05 m s−1 (accelerometer). The compensation technique reduced the maximum root mean square errors ({RMSEs}) to: {RMSEθ}=14.6° (orientation) and {RMSEd}=17.7 cm (positioning) for an integration interval of one gait cycle (an improvement of 3° and 7 cm); {RMSEθ}=14.8° and {RMSEd}=30.0 cm for an integration interval of two gait cycles (an improvement of 11° and 262 cm).},

Additionally, this generation of alarms promises to maximize system life. Throughput and energy efficiency of the communication protocol must also be carefully optimized. In this article we investigate {ZigBee}’s ability to meet {WBSN} requirements, with higher communication efficiency and lower power consumption than a Bluetooth serial port profile ({SPP}) based solution. As a case study we implemented an accelerometer-based fall detection algorithm, able to detect eight different fall typologies by means of a single sensor worn on the subjects’ waist. This algorithm has a low computational complexity and can be processed on an embedded platform. Fall simulations were performed by three voluntary subjects. Preliminary results are promising and show excellent values for both sensitivity and specificity.

Through this "saturation" effect, and in some cases by a more direct method, the spin-lattice relaxation time T1 can be measured. The interaction among the magnetic nuclei, with which a characteristic time T2′ is associated, contributes to the width of the absorption line.

Temperature imaging based on {iMQCs} can provide absolute temperature maps that circumvent the artefacts that other proton frequency shift techniques suffer from such as distortions to the detected temperature due to susceptibility changes and magnetic field inhomogeneities. Thermometry based on {iMQCs} is promising in high-fat tissues such as the breast, since it relies on the fat signal as an internal reference. This review covers the theoretical background of {iMQCs}, and the necessary adaptations for temperature imaging using {iMQCs}. Materials and methods: Data is presented from several papers on {iMQC} temperature imaging. These studies were done at 7T in both phantoms and in vivo. Results from phantoms of cream (homogeneous mixture of water and fat) are presented as well as in vivo temperature maps in obese mice. Results: Thermometry based on {iMQCs} offers the potential to provide temperature maps which are free of artefacts due to susceptibility and magnetic field inhomogeneities, and detect temperature on an absolute scale. Conclusions: The data presented in the papers reviewed highlights the promise of {iMQC}-based temperature imaging in fatty tissues such as the breast. The change in susceptibility of fat with temperature makes standard proton frequency shift methods (even with fat suppression) challenging and {iMQC}-based imaging offers an alternative approach.},

Generalized Dixon chemical shift–based water-fat separation methods, such as {GE}'s iterative decomposition of water and fat with echo asymmetry and least-squares estimation method, can result in complex water and fat images. Once separated, the phase change over time of the water signal can be used to map temperature. Phase change of the lipid signal can be used to correct for non-temperature-dependent phase changes, such as amplitude of static field drift. In this work, an image acquisition and postprocessing method, called water and fat thermal {MRI}, is demonstrated in phantoms containing 30:70, 50:50, and 70:30 water-to-fat by volume. Noninvasive heating was applied in an Off1-On-Off2 pattern over 50 min, using a miniannular phased radiofrequency array. Temperature changes were referenced to the first image acquisition. Four fiber optic temperature probes were placed inside the phantoms for temperature comparison. Region of interest ({ROI}) temperature values colocated with the probes showed excellent agreement (global mean ± standard deviation: −0.09 ± 0.34°C) despite significant amplitude of static field drift during the experiments.

The objectives of this study are: 1) to describe the absolute and relative accuracy of multiple units of commercially available {AHRS} under various types of motion; and 2) to evaluate the effect of motion velocity on the accuracy of these measurements.{MethodsThe} criterion validity of accuracy was established under controlled conditions using an instrumented Gimbal table. {AHRS} modules were carefully attached to the center plate of the Gimbal table and put through experimental static and dynamic conditions. Static and absolute accuracy was assessed by comparing the {AHRS} orientation measurement to those obtained using an optical gold standard. Relative accuracy was assessed by measuring the variation in relative orientation between modules during trials.{FindingsEvaluated} {AHRS} systems demonstrated good absolute static accuracy (mean error {\textless} 0.5o) and clinically acceptable absolute accuracy under condition of slow motions (mean error between 0.5o and 3.1o). In slow motions, relative accuracy varied from 2o to 7o depending on the type of {AHRS} and the type of rotation. Absolute and relative accuracy were significantly affected (p{\textless}0.05) by velocity during sustained motions. The extent of that effect varied across {AHRS}.{InterpretationAbsolute} and relative accuracy of {AHRS} are affected by environmental magnetic perturbations and conditions of motions. Relative accuracy of {AHRS} is mostly affected by the ability of all modules to locate the same global reference coordinate system at all time.{ConclusionsExisting} {AHRS} systems can be considered for use in clinical biomechanics under constrained conditions of use. While their individual capacity to track absolute motion is relatively consistent, the use of multiple {AHRS} modules to compute relative motion between rigid bodies needs to be optimized according to the conditions of operation.},

	abstract = {Most previous studies of electromyography ({EMG}) pattern recognition with both able-bodied subjects and amputees for control of multifunctional prostheses had verified high performance in identifying different movements. While these movements mostly refer to single joint, it remains unclear whether the functional tasks involved in arm and hand could be discriminated by using {EMG} pattern based methods. In this pilot study, we investigated the performance of {EMG} pattern recognition in classifying eight functional movements plus a “no movement” task. Four kinds of {EMG} feature sets, time-domain ({TD}) features, auto-regression ({AR}) model features, combination of {TD} and {AR} features, and wavelet packet coefficients, were used to represent the {EMG} patterns, respectively. Using a linear discriminant analysis classifier, the {TD} features outperformed other three feature sets. The average classification accuracy of the {TD} features across four able-bodied subjects was greater than 94\%. And the feasibility of {EMG} channels reduction was estimated with straightforward exhaustive search algorithm in terms of classification accuracy. The average classification accuracy of all 8-channel {EMG} combinations could achieve above 90\%. This result was encouraging and suggested that it is feasible to use {EMG} pattern recognition for the classification of functional movements.},

The {MARG} implementation incorporates magnetic distortion compensation. The algorithm uses a quaternion representation, allowing accelerometer and magnetometer data to be used in an analytically derived and optimised gradient descent algorithm to compute the direction of the gyroscope measurement error as a quaternion derivative. Performance has been evaluated empirically using a commercially available orientation sensor and reference measurements of orientation obtained using an optical measurement system. Performance was also benchmarked against the propriety Kalman-based algorithm of orientation sensor. Results indicate the algorithm achieves levels of accuracy matching that of the Kalman based algorithm; {\textless}; 0.8° static {RMS} error, {\textless}; 1.7° dynamic {RMS} error.

	abstract = {Proton resonance frequency ({PRF}) shift {MRI} thermometry was incorporated into a fast low angle shot imaging sequence to acquire two-dimensional temperature maps of two model liquid–particulate mixtures undergoing ohmic heating process. The samples used consisted of two phases, namely whey gel and {NaCl} solution, and were enclosed in an in-house made ohmic heating device driven by an 143 V {AC} power supply. Salt was added to the gel and solution to alter their electrical conductivity. The {PRF} shift was used as a temperature indicator, which was linearly and reversibly proportional to the temperature change. The specific {PRF} shift for the whey gel was determined as −0.0098 and −0.0097 ppm/°C for the two samples. For the {NaCl} solution, the values were −0.0096 and −0.0102 ppm/°C, respectively. Detailed temperature maps with spatial resolution of 0.94 mm and temporal resolution of 0.64 s were obtained. The temperature uncertainties were about ±1 °C for the whey gel and ±2 °C for the solution. The ease to interpret, the speed, and the accuracy of this new technique justify its applications in dynamic food process. The temperature maps provided details for the investigation of uneven heating of a liquid–particulate mixture undergoing ohmic heating and this temperature mapping technique is a powerful tool for ohmic model development and validation.},

	abstract = {The advent of the Kinect depth imager has opened the door to motion capture applications that would have been much more costly with previous technologies. In part, the Kinect achieves this by focusing on a very specific application domain, thus narrowing the requirement for the motion capture system. Specifically, Kinect motion capture works best within a small physical space while the camera is stationary. We seek to extend Kinect motion capture for use in athletic training - speed skating in particular - by placing the Kinect on a mobile, robotic platform to capture motion in situ. Athletes move over large distances, so the mobile platform addresses the limited viewing area of the Kinect. As the platform moves, we must also account for the now dynamic background against which the athlete performs. The result is a novel, visually-guided robotic platform that follows athletes, allowing us to capture motion and images that would not be possible with a treadmill. We describe the system in detail and give examples of the system capturing the motion of a speed skater at typical training speeds.},

In addition to had used in the scientific community, Medical, Engineering, {MOCAP} is currently being used extensively in film and animation industry to create realistic movement of the characters and cartoons. A popular {MOCAP} system used to capture the movement is Optical Motion Capture, called Optical {MOCAP} that is able to apply a variety of object motions. Nowadays, the price of {MOCAP} system is high. And if the user uses full system of {MOCAP} to capture the movement of actor, some incorrect movement data occurred. This reason, the user needs to take a lot of effort to correct the movement data. With the high price and used effort, making institution or manufacturer difficult for decision-making provides the {MOCAP} to use. This research has the idea to study the adjustment device of {MOCAP} system that has minimal system and proper motions for basic of full body human movement, including of walking, running and jumping. By adjusting the number of cameras, the number of reflect markers, the placement of the camera.

Original equations predicting {EE} were created from data obtained during three running intensities (25\%, 50\% and 70\% of {HR} reserve) performed by 50 subjects. Five equations were conserved according to their accuracy assessed from error rates, interchangeability and correlations analyses: one containing only basic parameters, two containing {VO}2max or speed at {VO}2max and two including running speed with or without {HR}. Equations accuracy was further tested in an independent sample during a 40 min validation test at 50\% of {HR} reserve. It appeared that: (1) the new basic equation was more accurate than pre-existing equations (R2 0.809 versus. 0,737 respectively); (2) the prediction of {EE} was more accurate with the addition of {VO}2max (R2 = 0.879); and (3) the equations containing running speed were the most accurate and were considered to have good agreement with indirect calorimetry. In conclusion, {EE} estimation during running might be significantly improved by including running speed in the predictive models, a parameter readily available with treadmill or {GPS}.},

	abstract = {Energy expenditure measurement is crucial to understand the biophysics of any kind of human locomotion. Despite the promising application of inertial measurement unit ({IMU}) for quantification of the energy expenditure during human on-land activities, it has never been deployed before to calculate the aquatic activities energy expenditure. Wearable {IMUs} were used in this paper to capture biomechanically interpretable descriptors of swimming. These descriptors were fed as inputs to a Bayesian linear model for estimation of the energy expenditure. To enhance generalization capacity of the estimator, a non-linear adjustment of the Bayesian model was devised using swimmer's anthropometric parameters. We used a set of four waterproofed {IMUs} worn on forearms, sacrum, and right shank of eighteen swimmers to extract the main spatiotemporal determinants of the front-crawl energy expenditure. The swimmers performed three 300-m trials at 70\%, 80\%, and 90\% of their 400-m personal best time. At the end of each 300 m, the reference value of energy expenditure was measured based on indirect calorimetry and blood lactate concentration. The assessment of the proposed model on the test data shows a strong association between the estimated and reference energy expenditure (Spearman's rho=0.93, ) and a high relative precision of 9.4\%. The backward elimination of model parameters with minimum rms error criterion shows that by excluding the features extracted from forearm sensors, i.e., using only two {IMUs}, we can still achieve an error of 0.9±11.3\%.},

The {TCP} set design was an integration of the {TCP}, temperature measurement unit, display unit, and control unit. The proposed {MRI} calibration kit, which is a combination of the {TCP} set and standard {MRI} phantom, was used in the {MRI} thermometry calibration and {MRI} quality calibration.
The {TCP} set provided an efficient, accurate, and homogeneous temperature map as the reference standard temperature for calibration. Accuracy and heating efficiency of the {TCP} set were 1°C and 1°C/minute, respectively. Calibration of the {MRI} thermometry and {MRI} quality were implemented successfully.
The proposed {TCP} set is completely compatible with the {MRI} system and can be used to calibrate {MRI} thermometry and {MRI} quality to ensure the quality performance of the {MRI} temperature imaging system.},

It is even more difficult to obtain an overview on patient cohorts for a comparison. Moreover, there is a growing awareness of the need for a concise index, specifically, a single measure of the ‘quality’ of a particular gait pattern. Several gait summary measures, which have been used in conjunction with 3D-{GA}, have been proposed to objectify clinical impression, quantify the degree of gait deviation from normal, stratify the severity of pathology, document the changes in gait patterns over time and evaluate interventions.},

An alternative accelerometer position at the anterolateral aspect of the middle shank did measure steps more accurately than at the manufacturer suggested position, especially during slow velocities. Participants preferred the alternative placement at the shank. The accuracy of different accelerometer positions was excellent at velocities between 1.0 and 2.2 m/s. During slow velocities below 1.0 m/s steps were recorded less accurately. Accepting an error of five percent, the accelerometer recorded steps accurately from 0.5 m/s at the alternative placement and from 0.8 m/s at the manufacturer suggested placement. Stair climbing was not recorded accurately by any accelerometer position.
For measuring step number during slow velocities, the alternative position should be favoured. Stair climbing was not recorded accurately by any tested placement.},

Given an articulated template model and silhouettes from a multi-view image sequence, our approach recovers not only the movement of the skeleton, but also the possibly non-rigid temporal deformation of the 3D surface. While large scale deformations or fast movements are captured by the skeleton pose and approximate surface skinning, true small scale deformations or non-rigid garment motion are captured by fitting the surface to the silhouette. We further propose a novel optimization scheme for skeleton-based pose estimation that exploits the skeleton's tree structure to split the optimization problem into a local one and a lower dimensional global one. We show on various sequences that our approach can capture the 3D motion of animals and humans accurately even in the case of rapid movements and wide apparel like skirts.},

	abstract = {This paper concerns body attitude (orientation) estimation for free ranging animal. The main idea of the proposed approach combines a quaternion-based nonlinear observer with an Iterated Least Squares Algorithm ({ILSA}) and exploits measurements from Micro-Electro-Mechanical-System ({MEMS}) sensors as 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis magnetometer and 3-axis gyroscope to produce attitude estimates during the entire range of the observed animal's body movements. Moreover, the proposed observer allows estimating the bias in gyroscope which is used to correct the angular velocity measurements in the attitude estimation step. Since, biologists use an index of {DBA} for evaluating the energy consumption of the moving animal; the resulting estimations are then used to extract the Dynamic Body Acceleration ({DBA}) of the animal. Note that, this work is necessary in Bio-logging science and allows monitoring aspects of animal's biology (behavior, movement, and physiology) and environments. The performance of the algorithm is theoretically proven and illustrated by an attitude estimation example. Moreover, the efficiency of the proposed approach is shown with a set of experiments through sensor measurements provided by an Inertial Measurement Unit ({IMU}). We have also included some comparison results with another method already applied in Bio-logging field in order to point out the improvements issued from the proposed approach.},

Magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) temperature imaging systems need to be routinely calibrated to guarantee accurate temperature results and qualified {MRI}. No independent physical temperature calibration phantom ({TCP}) set is currently available. An economical {TCP} set was developed to routinely ensure the quality of {MRI} temperature imaging system.
Materials and Methods
The novel {TCP} was constructed using a heating unit, temperature sensor, and {MRI} phantom liquid. A specialized heating unit was developed using carbon fibers. The {TCP} set design was an integration of the {TCP}, temperature measurement unit, display unit, and control unit. The proposed {MRI} calibration kit, which is a combination of the {TCP} set and standard {MRI} phantom, was used in the {MRI} thermometry calibration and {MRI} quality calibration.
Results
The {TCP} set provided an efficient, accurate, and homogeneous temperature map as the reference standard temperature for calibration. Accuracy and heating efficiency of the {TCP} set were 1°C and 1°C/minute, respectively. Calibration of the {MRI} thermometry and {MRI} quality were implemented successfully.
Conclusion
The proposed {TCP} set is completely compatible with the {MRI} system and can be used to calibrate {MRI} thermometry and {MRI} quality to ensure the quality performance of the {MRI} temperature imaging system.},

	abstract = {A method is presented which allows precise temperature and longitudinal (T1) relaxation time measurements with high spatial and temporal resolution. This is achieved by combining dynamic variable flip angle based T1 relaxation mapping with proton resonance frequency shift based thermometry. Herein, dynamic T1 mapping is either used as a complementary measure of temperature or for the detection of T1 contrast agent release. For the first application, the temperature evolution during a high-intensity focused ultrasound tissue ablation experiment was measured in both, porcine fat and muscle, simultaneously. In this application, temperature accuracies of 2.5 K for T1-based thermometry in fat and 1.2 K for proton resonance frequency shift-based thermometry in muscle were observed. The second application relates to {MR}-guidance of high-intensity focused ultrasound-induced local drug delivery by means of thermo-sensitive liposomes labeled with a T1 contrast agent (Gd-{HPDO}3A). When the measured temperature exceeded the phase transition temperature of the liposomes, T1 was observed to decrease with a good temporal and spatial correlation due to the release of Gd-{HPDO}3A. The presented results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method for two important applications in {MR}-guided noninvasive therapy. It offers a high temporal resolution when compared with interleaved Look-Locker based T1 mapping techniques and thus represents an interesting candidate for simultaneous real-time monitoring of T1 and temperature changes.

	abstract = {Over the centuries the evolution of methods for the capture of human movement has been motivated by the need for new information on the characteristics of normal and pathological human movement. This study was motivated in part by the need of new clinical approaches for the treatment and prevention of diseases that are influenced by subtle changes in the patterns movement. These clinical approaches require new methods to measure accurately patterns of locomotion without the risk of artificial stimulus producing unwanted artifacts that could mask the natural patterns of motion. Most common methods for accurate capture of three-dimensional human movement require a laboratory environment and the attachment of markers or fixtures to the body's segments. These laboratory conditions can cause unknown experimental artifacts. Thus, our understanding of normal and pathological human movement would be enhanced by a method that allows the capture of human movement without the constraint of markers or fixtures placed on the body. In this paper, the need for markerless human motion capture methods is discussed and the advancement of markerless approaches is considered in view of accurate capture of three-dimensional human movement for biomechanical applications. The role of choosing appropriate technical equipment and algorithms for accurate markerless motion capture is critical. The implementation of this new methodology offers the promise for simple, time-efficient, and potentially more meaningful assessments of human movement in research and clinical practice. The feasibility of accurately and precisely measuring 3D human body kinematics for the lower limbs using a markerless motion capture system on the basis of visual hulls is demonstrated.

A small portable device that is able to obtain acceleration data during exercise was developed. It was attached on the back, wrist, knee and ankle of the body and then submaximal exercise was conducted on treadmills with the Bruce protocol. For the experimentation, seventeen males of twenties and thirties in good health (27.23plusmn2.18) participated and wore the equipment to analyze respiratory gas, so that the values of acceleration and energy expenditure from the respiratory gas analyzer could be obtained at the same time. The energy expenditure values from the outputs of the respiratory gas equipment were set as a base value, and the accelerations and the physical features of the participants (age, weight, height and {BMI}) as variables, to check each correlation, and for each of the four locations of the accelerometers on the body, regression analysis was carried out. The results of the experiment are as follows: the correlation between the acceleration and the energy expenditure was the highest on the knee and the lowest on the wrist; but, the determination coefficients (R2) of the regression equations using the continued hours of exercise, weight and acceleration values did not show significant difference among the locations on the body, as the highest R2=0.873 on the back and the lowest R2=0.852 on the wrist. This study has shown two possibilities. First, it is possible to predict energy expenditure using accelerometer sensor without respiration gas analyzer in laboratory situation. Second, these findings can be applied to application about predicting conveniently- - energy expenditure during outdoor activities using accelerometer on watch or shoes.},

Five equations were conserved according to their accuracy assessed from error rates, interchangeability and correlations analyses: one containing only basic parameters, two containing {VO}2max or speed at {VO}2max and two including running speed with or without {HR}. Equations accuracy was further tested in an independent sample during a 40 min validation test at 50\% of {HR} reserve. It appeared that: (1) the new basic equation was more accurate than pre-existing equations (R-2 0.809 versus. 0,737 respectively); (2) the prediction of {EE} was more accurate with the addition of {VO}2max (R-2 = 0.879); and (3) the equations containing running speed were the most accurate and were considered to have good agreement with indirect calorimetry. In conclusion, {EE} estimation during running might be significantly improved by including running speed in the predictive models, a parameter readily available with treadmill or {GPS}.},

We have researched about following two methods to recognize the voluntary movement: one is low pass filter and neural network ({NN}), the other is short time Fourier transform and {NN}. The low pass filter and neural network ({NN}) were effective for recognition of healthy subject's movement. However, these methods were not applied to the tremor patient's movement due to the characteristic oscillation of the {EMG} signal in the tremor patient. The proposed algorithm, which was composed of the short time Fourier transform and {NN}, dramatically improved the recognition rate of tremor patient's movement. It was confirmed that the signal processing using {STFT} and {NN} is suitable for the recognition of the tremor patients.

The possible significance of the kind of imagery, involving rather kinesthetic or visual representations of actions, was addressed using the following experimental conditions: kinesthetic motor imagery ({MIK}), visual–motor imagery ({MIV}), motor execution ({ME}) and observation of movement ({OOM}). Based on multi-channel {EEG} recordings in 14 right-handed participants, we applied a learning classifier, the distinction sensitive learning vector quantization ({DSLVQ}) to identify relevant features (i.e., frequency bands, electrode sites) for recognition of the respective mental states. For {ME} and {OOM}, the overall classification accuracies were about 80\%. The rates obtained for {MIK} (67\%) were better than the results of {MIV} (56\%). Moreover, the focus of activity during kinesthetic imagery was found close to the sensorimotor hand area, whereas visual–motor imagery did not reveal a clear spatial pattern. Consequently, to improve motor-imagery-based {BCI} control, user training should emphasize kinesthetic experiences instead of visual representations of actions.},

The suggested applications are for studies in the field of human movement. In the proposed {EKF}, the quaternion associated with the body rotation is included in the state vector together with the bias of the aiding system sensors. Moreover, in addition to the in-line procedure of sensor bias compensation, the measurement noise covariance matrix is adapted, to guard against the effects which body motion and temporary magnetic disturbance may have on the reliability of measurements of gravity and earth's magnetic field, respectively. By computer simulations and experimental validation with human hand orientation motion signals, improvements in the accuracy of orientation estimates are demonstrated for the proposed {EKF}, as compared with filter implementations where either the in-line calibration procedure, the adaptive mechanism for weighting the measurements of the aiding system sensors, or both are not implemented.},

Five categories of human motion were done including walking, running, going upstairs, fall and standing. Fourier analysis was used to extract the feature from the human motion data. The concentrated information was finally used to categorize the human motions through {HMM} (hidden Markov model) process. Experimental results show that for the given 5 human motions, correct recognition rate range from 90\% -100\%. Also, a full combination of 6 parameters (Gx, Gy, Gz, Ax, Ay, Az) was listed and the recognition rate of each combination (total 63) was tested.},

The feature pair used for classification is mapped from an ensemble of 16 features extracted from the accelerometer data for each activity epoch. Two different versions of the classifier are presented to combine the multi-dimensional nature of the accelerometer data, and their results are compared in terms of correct recognition rate of the segmented activities, on two population samples of different age.

	abstract = {Temperature‐dependencemeasurements have been made on the chemical shift of the proton of a water molecule in the liquid state and in the gas state at varying pressure. The problem of relating these experimental data to the intermolecular forces leading to cohesion and to hydrogen‐bond formation between water molecules is considered in detail. It is shown that a consistent treatment of the chemical shift, thermal, and dielectric data for water can be given based on a two‐state model involving an equilibrium between a hydrogen‐bonded ``icelike\&apos;\&apos; fraction and a ``monomer\&apos;\&apos; fraction whose interaction with the lattice arises entirely from London dispersion forces. Using semiempirically derived values of the chemical shift and energy associated with the condensation of water vapor to ``monomer,\&apos;\&apos; the magnitude of the shift associated with the transformation to ice is calculated. It is then shown that, on the assumption that the hydrogen bond is electrostatic in character, the ``polar\&apos;\&apos; contribution to this shift can be related through the appropriate shielding equations to the dipole moment of the water molecule in ice. The magnitude of the dipole moment derived from these relationships is found to be in excellent agreement with values derived from dielectric data. The possibility that the shielding changes may in part be due to processes other than the breaking of hydrogen bonds is considered. It is shown that the model leads to the conclusion that the chemical shift in the transformation of ice to water at 0°C could be entirely accounted for either by a stretching of the hydrogen bonds or a small amount of bending of the bonds. It is noted that if some bond breaking does occur, as required by the fact that water is a liquid, then the amount of stretching and/or bending will be limited.},

We developed a model to predict cell death from {MR} thermometry measurements and applied it to in vivo rabbit brain data. To align post-ablation T2-weighted spin-echo {MR} lesion images to gradient echo {MR} images, from which temperature is derived, we used a registration method that aligned fiducials placed near the thermal lesion. We used the outer boundary of the hyperintense rim in the post-ablation {MR} lesion image as the boundary for cell death, as verified from histology. Model parameters were simultaneously estimated using an iterative optimization algorithm applied to every interesting pixel in 328 images from multiple experiments having various temperature histories. For a necrotic region of 766 voxels across all lesions, the model gave a voxel specificity and sensitivity of 98.1\% and 78.4\%, respectively. Median distance between the segmented necrotic boundary and the mislabeled voxels was within one {MR} voxel. Furthermore, our model predicted fewer errors as compared to the critical temperature cell death model. This is good evidence that {iMRI} temperature maps can be used with our model to predict therapeutic regions in real-time.},

	abstract = {The assessment of metabolic parameters related to energy expenditure has a proven value for weight management; however these measurements remain too difficult and costly for monitoring individuals at home. The objective of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of a new pocket-sized metabolic analyzer device for assessing energy expenditure at rest ({REE}) and during sedentary activities ({EE}). The new device performs indirect calorimetry by measuring an individual's oxygen consumption ({VO}2) and carbon dioxide production ({VCO}2) rates, which allows the determination of resting- and sedentary activity-related energy expenditure.
{VO}2 and {VCO}2 values of 17 volunteer adult subjects were measured during resting and sedentary activities in order to compare the metabolic analyzer with the Douglas bag method. The Douglas bag method is considered the Gold Standard method for indirect calorimetry. Metabolic parameters of {VO}2, {VCO}2, and energy expenditure were compared using linear regression analysis, paired t-tests, and Bland–Altman plots.
Linear regression analysis of measured {VO}2 and {VCO}2 values, as well as calculated energy expenditure assessed with the new analyzer and Douglas bag method, had the following linear regression parameters (linear regression slope {LRS}0, and R-squared coefficient, r2) with p = 0: {LRS}0 ({SD}) = 1.00 (0.01), r2 = 0.9933 for {VO}2; {LRS}0 ({SD}) = 1.00 (0.01), r2 = 0.9929 for {VCO}2; and {LRS}0 ({SD}) = 1.00 (0.01), r2 = 0.9942 for energy expenditure. In addition, results from paired t-tests did not show statistical significant difference between the methods with a significance level of α = 0.05 for {VO}2, {VCO}2, {REE}, and {EE}. Furthermore, the Bland–Altman plot for {REE} showed good agreement between methods with 100\% of the results within ±2SD, which was equivalent to ≤10\% error.
The findings demonstrate that the new pocket-sized metabolic analyzer device is accurate for determining {VO}2, {VCO}2, and energy expenditure.},

This method is based on water saturation shift referencing ({WASSR}), a method first developed for assessing B-0 field inhomogeneity. Temperature-induced water {PRF} shifts were determined by estimating the frequency of the minimum intensity of the water direct saturation spectrum at each temperature using Lorentzian line-shape fitting. The change in temperature was then calculated from the difference in water {PRF} shifts between temperatures. Optimal acquisition parameters were first estimated using simulations and later confirmed experimentally. Results in vitro and in vivo showed that the temperature changes measured using the temperature-responsive {WASSR} (T-{WASSR}) were in good agreement with those obtained with {MR} spectroscopy or phase-mapping-based water {PRF} measurement methods,. In addition, the feasibility of temperature mapping in fat-containing tissue is demonstrated in vitro. In conclusion, the T-{WASSR} approach provides an alternative for non-invasive temperature mapping by {MRI}, especially suitable for temperature measurements in fat-containing tissues.

The existing human motion capture techniques, which use structured multiple high-resolution cameras in a dedicated studio, are complicated and expensive. With the rapid development of microsensors on chip, a ubiquitous real-time low-cost human motion capture system that uses wearable microsensors becomes possible. Because of the agility in movement, upper limb motion estimation has been regarded as the most difficult problem in human motion capture. In this paper, we take the upper limb as our research subject and present a novel upper limb motion estimation algorithm by hierarchical fusion of sensor data and human skeleton constraints. Our method represents the orientations of upper limb segments in quaternion, which is computationally effective and can avoid the singularity problem. To address the nonlinear human body segment motion, a particle filter is proposed to fuse inertial and magnetic sensor data. To compensate for the drift, which is the most challenging issue in motion estimation using inertial sensors, we present a novel solution by modeling the geometrical constraint in elbow joint and fuse the constraint in the framework of particle filter to revise the sensor fusion results and improve the estimation accuracy.

	abstract = {Background/Aim
Three-dimensional kinematic measures of gait are routinely used in clinical gait analysis and provide a key outcome measure for gait research and clinical practice. This systematic review identifies and evaluates current evidence for the inter-session and inter-assessor reliability of three-dimensional kinematic gait analysis (3DGA) data.
Method
A targeted search strategy identified reports that fulfilled the search criteria. The quality of full-text reports were tabulated and evaluated for quality using a customised critical appraisal tool.
Results
Fifteen full manuscripts and eight abstracts were included. Studies addressed both within-assessor and between-assessor reliability, with most examining healthy adults. Four full-text reports evaluated reliability in people with gait pathologies. The highest reliability indices occurred in the hip and knee in the sagittal plane, with lowest errors in pelvic rotation and obliquity and hip abduction. Lowest reliability and highest error frequently occurred in the hip and knee transverse plane. Methodological quality varied, with key limitations in sample descriptions and strategies for statistical analysis. Reported reliability indices and error magnitudes varied across gait variables and studies. Most studies providing estimates of data error reported values (S.D. or S.E.) of less than 5°, with the exception of hip and knee rotation.
Conclusion
This review provides evidence that clinically acceptable errors are possible in gait analysis. Variability between studies, however, suggests that they are not always achieved.},

This study evaluated the concurrent validity of trunk accelerations derived from a tri-axial inertial measurement unit while walking on firm, compliant and uneven surfaces and contrasted two methods used to remove gravitational accelerations; i) subtraction of the best linear fit from the data (detrending); and ii) use of orientation information (quaternions) from the inertial measurement unit. Twelve older and twelve younger adults walked at their preferred speed along firm, compliant and uneven walkways. Accelerations were evaluated for the thoracic spine (T12) using a tri-axial inertial measurement unit and an eleven-camera Vicon system. The findings demonstrated excellent agreement between accelerations derived from the inertial measurement unit and motion analysis system, including while walking on uneven surfaces that better approximate a real-world setting (all differences {\textless}0.16 m.s−2). Detrending produced slightly better agreement between the inertial measurement unit and Vicon system on firm surfaces (delta range: −0.05 to 0.06 vs. 0.00 to 0.14 m.s−2), whereas the quaternion method performed better when walking on compliant and uneven walkways (delta range: −0.16 to −0.02 vs. −0.07 to 0.07 m.s−2). The technique used to compensate for gravitational accelerations requires consideration in future research, particularly when walking on compliant and uneven surfaces. These findings demonstrate trunk accelerations can be accurately measured using a wireless inertial measurement unit and are appropriate for research that evaluates healthy populations in complex environments.},

With rapid advances in microsensors, human movement estimation using wearable micro inertial sensors has become an active research topic. The main challenges for the wearable sensor motion estimation are the inertial sensor drift problem and the linear acceleration interference problem. Because of the agility in movement, upper limb motion estimation has been regarded as the most difficult problem in human motion estimation. In this paper, we take the upper limb as our research subject and present a novel upper limb movement estimation algorithm to cope with these two challenges by adaptive fusion of sensor data and human skeleton constraint. In the sensor fusion part, a quaternion-based unscented Kalman filter is invoked to fuse the gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer measurement information. In the Kalman filter framework, an acceleration interference detection scheme is implemented based on the exponentially discounted average of the normalized innovation squared ({NIS}). According to the detection results, the process and measurement noise levels are scaled up or down automatically. To further compensate for the drift, we present a novel solution by modeling geometrical constraint in the elbow joint and fuse the constraint to revise the sensor fusion results and improve the estimation accuracy. The experimental results have shown that the proposed algorithm can provide accurate results in comparison to the {BTS} {SMART}-D optical motion tracker.},

With severe damage, a forced-choice decision between categories was possible even when the choice of the particular semantic vector within the category was not possible. The damaged networks typically exhibited many mixed visual and semantic errors in which the output corresponded to a word that was both visually and semantically similar.

Pre-test calibration and in-test error compensation are commonly used to minimize the sensor errors and improve the accuracy of the walking speed estimation results. However, the performance of a given sensor error compensation method does not only depend on the accuracy of the calibration or the sensor error evaluation, but also strongly relies on the selected sensor error model. The best performance could be achieved only when the essential components of sensor errors are included and compensated. Two new sensor error models, with the concerns about sensor acceleration measurement biases and sensor attachment misalignment, have been developed. The performance of these two error models were evaluated in the shank-mounted {IMU}-based walking speed/inclination estimation algorithm with a comparison of an existing error model. The treadmill walking experiment, conducted at both level and incline conditions, demonstrated the importance of sensor error model selection on the spatio-temporal gait parameter estimation performance. Accurate walking inclination estimation was made possible with a newly developed sensor error model.},

We obtained {MRSI} data from 31 healthy male volunteers [age range, 22–40 years; mean ± standard deviation ({SD}), 30.5 ± 5.0 years]. Eleven subjects (age range, 23–40 years; mean ± {SD}, 30.5 ± 5.2 years) were invited to receive four point-resolved spectroscopy {MRSI} scans on each of 3 days in both 1.5-T ({TR}/{TE} = 1000/144 ms) and 3-T ({TR}/{TE} = 1700/144 ms) clinical scanners; a further 20 subjects (age range, 22–40 years; mean ± {SD}, 30.5 ± 4.9 years) were scanned on a single occasion at 3 T. Data were fitted in the time domain to determine the water–N-acetylaspartate chemical shift difference, from which the temperature was estimated. Temperature data were analysed using a linear mixed effects model to determine variance components and systematic temperature changes during the scanning sessions. To characterise the effects of instrumental drift on apparent {MRSI} brain temperature, a temperature-controlled phantom was constructed and scanned on multiple occasions. Components of apparent in vivo temperature variability at 1.5 T/3 T caused by inter-subject (0.18/0.17 °C), inter-session (0.18/0.15 °C) and within-session (0.36/0.14 °C) effects, as well as voxel-to-voxel variation (0.59/0.54 °C), were determined. There was a brain cooling effect during in vivo {MRSI} of 0.10 °C [95\% confidence interval ({CI}): –0.110, –0.094 °C; p {\textless} 0.001] and 0.051 °C (95\% {CI}: –0.054, –0.048 °C; p {\textless} 0.001) per scan at 1.5 T and 3 T, respectively, whereas phantom measurements revealed minimal drift in apparent {MRSI} temperature relative to fibre-optic temperature measurements. The mean brain temperature at 3 T was weakly associated with aural (R = 0.55, p = 0.002) and oral (R = 0.62, p {\textless} 0.001) measurements of head temperature. In conclusion, the variability associated with {MRSI} brain temperature mapping was quantified. Repeatability was somewhat higher at 3 T than at 1.5 T, although subtle spatial and temporal variations in apparent temperature were demonstrated at both field strengths. Such data should assist in the efficient design of future clinical studies. © 2013 The Authors. {NMR} in Biomedicine published by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Transfer alignment filter is used to estimate the relative attitude error between a slave strapdown inertial navigation system ({SINS}) and a master {INS}, the two important targets of which are rapidness and veracity. Transfer alignment filters have typically relied on velocity measurements from the master {SINS} as the source of alignment information, but lever arm error must be compensated accurately while velocity information is utilized. Nearly all the quaternion based error models are nonlinear, so nonlinear filtering algorithms are needed, suffering from computational complex. A novel improved rapid transfer alignment algorithm formulation is presented, applying quaternion to built the process and measurement model, and the dimension of the state and the measurement vectors are all reduced to four, the improvement employs a special manipulation of the measurement equation resulting in a linear pseudo measurement equation, thus the classical linear Kalman filter is employed to estimate the state, avoiding lever arm error compensation, resulting in the reducing of computational burden. A transfer alignment simulation system is also developed for the evaluation and analysis of the presented algorithm, and results show that the new novel method presented can achieve the transfer alignment accuracy under 1 milliradian.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a new factorized quaternion approach for determining the arm limbs' orientation using triaxial accelerometers with consideration of anatomical and sensor constraints. Typical use of the quaternion method determines the angle and axis of rotation represented by a single angle-axis quaternion. Different from the conventional approach, we propose using the factorized quaternion approach for the determination of arm motions. This approach allows the implementation of anatomical arm constraints which match the range of motion of the human arm and also reduces the ambiguity in solutions. In addition, the singularities arising from the use of triaxial accelerometers can be detected and resolved for a transient state. Measurement of the upper arm motion is demonstrated along a vertical plane and extended along a tilted plane for the forearm. Experiments have been conducted using a wireless sensor network equipped with triaxial accelerometers attached to the arm. The results have been benchmarked with a commercial inertial measurement unit to validate the feasibility and advantages of this new approach. Comparable performance in terms of accuracy has been obtained at a much reduced cost and power consumption.},

This special type of multivariate time series data is relevant in many research fields including medicine, sports and animation. Key tasks in working with motion data include analysis of motion states and transitions, and synthesis of motion vectors by interpolation and combination. In the practice of research and application of human motion data, challenges exist in providing visual summaries and drill-down functionality for handling large motion data collections. We find that this domain can benefit from appropriate visual retrieval and analysis support to handle these tasks in presence of large motion data. To address this need, we developed {MotionExplorer} together with domain experts as an exploratory search system based on interactive aggregation and visualization of motion states as a basis for data navigation, exploration, and search. Based on an overview-first type visualization, users are able to search for interesting sub-sequences of motion based on a query-by-example metaphor, and explore search results by details on demand. We developed {MotionExplorer} in close collaboration with the targeted users who are researchers working on human motion synthesis and analysis, including a summative field study. Additionally, we conducted a laboratory design study to substantially improve {MotionExplorer} towards an intuitive, usable and robust design. {MotionExplorer} enables the search in human motion capture data with only a few mouse clicks.

The magnetometer is combined with a three-axis accelerometer as a digital compass for orientation determination in static state by measuring the gravity and the earth's magnetic field vectors. A three-axis gyroscope is used to measure the orientation in dynamic state to complement the digital compass. Displacement determination is implemented using the accelerometer through double integration, and an ultrasonic sensor is employed to periodically calibrate the accumulated errors of the accelerometer. The redundant data from the multi-sensors are fused using extended Kalman filter ({EKF}), in which the position measured by the ultrasonic sensor and the orientation measured by the digital compass are defined as the observation values, and the position, velocity, and orientation are included in the state vector. Experimental results show that the accumulated errors of inertial sensors are reduced by ultrasonic sensors and magnetometers, and {EKF} improves the accuracy of orientation and position measurements.},

One approach employs an Extended Kalman filter ({EKF}) propagating the quaternion vector using conventional vector addition operation. However, due to the fact that the unit sphere defined by the quaternion vector is not an Euclidean vector space, the vector addition and scaling should principally not be directly applied. Therefore, in the second approach, an Unscented Kalman filter ({UKF}) is used which propagates the quaternion vector based on the quaternion product chain rule, having a natural way of maintaining the normalization constraint. A field experiment based on the train ride is made for the comparison. The objective is to verify whether different handlings of nonlinearity in system models and different ways of propagating quaternion vector over time will practically yield differences in the estimation of attitude and sensor bias errors.},

Unclear on-site status during fall accidents affects faculty advisors to respond to emergency situations. Therefore, this study constructed a safety practicum information system. The applied accelerometer determination-based mechanism automatically monitored the behavior of on-site students via mobile phones. For occurring accidental falls, the used image recognition-based mechanism visually highlighted the falling students through surveillance facilities. Relying on the test results in a surveying practicum, this study indicated that the safety practicum information system actively informed faculty advisors of accidental falls and clearly detailed on-site status (i.e., accident sites and falling students).

However the large noises inherent in low cost {MEMS} sensors degrade the derived attitude precision if utilized through the conventional methods, e.g. initial alignment, strapdown inertial navigation mechanization. Therefore the novel application approach suitable for {MEMS} needs to be investigated. This paper describes an attitude determination system that is based on low cost {MEMS} inertial sensor, a triad of magnetometers and a commercial {GPS} receiver. Two main issues are addressed in the paper; firstly determination of the attitude initials, the algorithm is based on a quaternion formulation, a representative of attitude, of Wahbapsilas problem, whereby the error quaternion becomes the estimated state and is corrected by two observations of the earth magnetic field and gravity respectively. After the estimates converge, the derived attitude parameters are employed to initialize the inertial navigation calculations. Due to the large noises in {MEMS} sensor, there is a demand for external velocity and/or position corrections in the {MEMS} navigation calculations when system experiences translational motions. Hence secondly, {GPS} solutions are integrated in a Kalman filter by providing external velocity and position observations. A Kalman dynamic model is designed appropriate for {MEMS} sensor noise characteristics. The bias and drift are estimated by the integrated Kalman filter, which enables the online calibrations of {MEMS} sensor. The proposed approach has been developed and its efficiency is demonstrated by various experimental scenarios with real {MEMS} data and they are compared with Novatel {SPAN}-{IMU} reference.},

This method is based on water saturation shift referencing ({WASSR}), a method first developed for assessing B0 field inhomogeneity. Temperature-induced water {PRF} shifts were determined by estimating the frequency of the minimum intensity of the water direct saturation spectrum at each temperature using Lorentzian line-shape fitting. The change in temperature was then calculated from the difference in water {PRF} shifts between temperatures. Optimal acquisition parameters were first estimated using simulations and later confirmed experimentally. Results in vitro and in vivo showed that the temperature changes measured using the temperature-responsive {WASSR} (T-{WASSR}) were in good agreement with those obtained with {MR} spectroscopy or phase-mapping-based water {PRF} measurement methods,. In addition, the feasibility of temperature mapping in fat-containing tissue is demonstrated in vitro. In conclusion, the T-{WASSR} approach provides an alternative for non-invasive temperature mapping by {MRI}, especially suitable for temperature measurements in fat-containing tissues.

Elderly people desire to live at home, and thus, new technologies, such as automated fall detectors, are needed to support their independence and security. The aim of this study was to evaluate different low-complexity fall detection algorithms, using triaxial accelerometers attached at the waist, wrist, and head. The fall data were obtained from standardized types of intentional falls (forward, backward, and lateral) in three middle-aged subjects. Data from activities of daily living were used as reference. Three different detection algorithms with increasing complexity were investigated using two or more of the following phases of a fall event: beginning of the fall, falling velocity, fall impact, and posture after the fall. The results indicated that fall detection using a triaxial accelerometer worn at the waist or head is efficient, even with quite simple threshold-based algorithms, with a sensitivity of 97–98\% and specificity of 100\%. The most sensitive acceleration parameters in these algorithms appeared to be the resultant signal with no high-pass filtering, and the calculated vertical acceleration. In this study, the wrist did not appear to be an applicable site for fall detection. Since a head worn device includes limitations concerning usability and acceptance, a waist worn accelerometer, using an algorithm that recognizes the impact and the posture after the fall, might be optimal for fall detection.},

	issn = {0031-9155},
	abstract = {Non-invasive detection of small temperature changes ({\textless} 1 degree C) is pivotal to the further advance of regional hyperthermia as a treatment modality for deep-seated tumours. Magnetic resonance ({MR}) thermography methods are considered to be a promising approach. Four methods exploiting temperature-dependent parameters were evaluated in phantom experiments. The investigated temperature indicators were spin-lattice relaxation time T1, diffusion coefficient D, shift of water proton resonance frequency (water {PRF}) and resonance frequency shift of the methoxy group of the praseodymium complex (Pr probe). The respective pulse sequences employed to detect temperature-dependent signal changes were the multiple readout single inversion recovery (T One by Multiple Read Out Pulses; {TOMROP}), the pulsed gradient spin echo ({PGSE}), the fast low-angle shot ({FLASH}) with phase difference reconstruction, and the classical chemical shift imaging ({CSI}). Applying these sequences, experiments were performed in two separate and consecutive steps. In the first step, calibration curves were recorded for all four methods. In the second step, applying these calibration data, maps of temperature changes were generated and verified. With the equal total acquisition time of approximately 4 min for all four methods, the uncertainties of temperature changes derived from the calibration curves were less than 1 degree C (Pr probe 0.11 degrees C, water {PRF} 0.22 degrees C, D 0.48 degrees C and T1 0.93 degrees C). The corresponding maps of temperature changes exhibited slightly higher errors but still in the range or less than 1 degree C (0.97 degrees C, 0.41 degrees C, 0.70 degrees C, 1.06 degrees C respectively). The calibration results indicate the Pr probe method to be most sensitive and accurate. However, this advantage could only be partially transferred to the thermographic maps because of the coarse 16 x 16 matrix of the classical {CSI} sequence. Therefore, at present the water {PRF} method appears to be most suitable for {MR} monitoring of small temperature changes during hyperthermia treatment.},

Micro inertial sensors, such as {MEMS} gyroscopes, can provide small, inexpensive, low power devices; however, the accuracy of these devices is insufficient for many space applications. Signal processing methods can be used to provide the necessary accuracy. The individual outputs of many nominally identical micro sensors can be combined to generate a single accurate measurement. An extended Kalman filter ({EKF}) (A.R. Stubberud and X.-H. Yu, 2000) which includes the dynamics of every sensor can be used for such a combination; however, the 'curse of dimensionality' limits the number of sensors which can be used. In this paper, a new {EKF} technique for combining many sensors is proposed which, using a common nominal model for the micro sensors and a single {EKF} with the state dimension of a single sensor, has accuracy comparable to the high dimensional {EKF} and is significantly more accurate than a single sensor.},

The experiments show that work-related motions barely affected the detection of falls, and the result had a sensitivity and specificity of 100\% and 96.1\%, respectively. However, for detecting portents, the work-related motions had quite a large impact on the gyroscope-based algorithm, which demonstrated an accuracy rate of only 4.3\%, but had only limited impact on the accelerometer-based algorithm, which still show acceptable accuracy rates of 73.5\% and 88.5\%.

In this article the principles of temperature measurements with these methods are reviewed and their usefulness for monitoring in vivo procedures is discussed. Whereas most measurements give a temperature change relative to a baseline condition, temperature-sensitive contrast agents and spectroscopic imaging can provide absolute temperature measurements. The excellent linearity and temperature dependence of the {PRF} and its near independence of tissue type have made {PRF}-based phase mapping methods the preferred choice for many in vivo applications.

Output data were recorded on a personal computer and also used to perform a live demo. During system modeling and design, it was chosen to represent angular position data with a quaternion and to use an extended Kalman filter as sensor fusion algorithm. For this purpose, a novel two-stage filter was designed: The first stage uses accelerometer data, and the second one uses magnetic compass data for angular position correction. This allows flexibility, less computational requirements, and robustness to magnetic field anomalies. The final goal of this work is to realize an upgraded application-specified integrated circuit that controls the microelectromechanical systems ({MEMS}) sensor and integrates the {ASIP}.

This paper introduces an approach for the indoor localization of a mini {UAV} based on Ultra-{WideBand} technology, low cost {IMU} and vision based sensors. In this work an Extended Kalman Filter ({EKF}) is introduced as a possible technique to improve the localization. The proposed approach allows to use a low-cost Inertial Measurement Unit ({IMU}) in the prediction step and the integration of vision-odometry for the detection of markers nearness the touchdown area. The ranging measurements allow to reduce the errors of inertial sensors due to the limited performance of accelerometers and gyros.

	abstract = {Due to the need for accurate navigation in minimally invasive surgery, many methods have been introduced to the operating room for tracking the position and orientation of instruments. This paper considers the subproblem of using integrated inertial and magnetic sensing to track the attitude (orientation) of surgical instruments. In this scenario, it is usually assumed that the sensor is quasi-static and the surrounding magnetic field is steady. For practical hand-held surgical instruments, perturbations exist due to intended and unintended (e.g., tremor) motion and due to distortion of the surrounding magnetic field. We consider the problem of estimating the gravity and magnetic field in the inertial sensor frame with small perturbations. The dynamics of the gravity and magnetic field is studied under perturbations, their relationships to gyroscope measurements are analyzed, and Kalman filters ({KFs}) are formulated to reduce these perturbations. The estimated gravity and magnetic values (outputs of the {KFs}) are subsequently used in an extended {KF} for attitude estimation. In this filter, the prediction model is given by the system dynamics, formulated using quaternions, and the observation model is given by vector analysis of the estimated gravity and magnetic field. Experiments are performed to validate the algorithms under clinically realistic motions. The complete system demonstrates an improvement in the accuracy of the attitude estimate in the presence of small perturbations, and satisfies the specified accuracy requirement of 1°.},

For the proposed approach, a low cost Inertial Measurement Unit ({IMU}), formed by 3-axis gyroscope, 3-axis accelerometer, and 3-axis magnetometer, provides the input measurements. A Kalman Filter, in direct configuration, estimates the state of the system, which is formed by a quaternion, representing the body 3D orientation, and the biases of gyros.

We consider in particular the recovery of both shape and parametric motion information as often required in applications that produce and manipulate animated 3D contents using multiple videos. To this aim, we propose an approach that jointly estimates skeleton joint positions and surface deformations by fitting a reference surface model to 3D point reconstructions. The approach is Based on a probabilistic deformable surface registration framework coupled with a bone binding energy. The former makes soft assignments between the model and the observations while the latter guides the skeleton fitting. The main benefit of this strategy lies in its ability to handle outliers and erroneous observations frequently present in multiview data. For the same purpose, we also introduce a learning Based method that partition the point cloud observations into different rigid body parts that further discriminate input data into classes in addition to reducing the complexity of the association between the model and the observations. We argue that such combination of a learning Based matching and of a probabilistic fitting framework efficiently handle unreliable observations with fake geometries or missing data and hence, it reduces the need for tedious manual interventions. A thorough evaluation of the method is presented that includes comparisons with related works on most publicly available multiview datasets.},

The results show that the method correctly recognized the 13 activity types 88.1\% of the time, which is 12.3\% higher than using a hip accelerometer alone. Also, the method predicted energy expenditure with a root mean square error of 0.42 {METs}, 22.2\% lower than using a hip accelerometer alone. Furthermore, the fusion method was effective in reducing the subject-to-subject variability (standard deviation of recognition accuracies across subjects) in activity recognition, especially when data from the ventilation sensor were added to the fusion model. These results demonstrate that the multisensor fusion technique presented is more effective in identifying activity type and energy expenditure than the traditional accelerometer-alone-based methods.},

Accelerometers were integrated into a hearing-aid housing, investigation into the acceleration patterns of the head of a young volunteer during intentional falls. The specificity was assessed by investigation into activities of daily living of the same volunteer. In addition, a healthy elderly woman (83 years) wore the sensor during the day. Three trigger thresholds were identified so that a fall could be recognised: the sum-vector of acceleration in the xy-plane higher than 2 g; the sumvector of velocity of all spatial components right before the impact higher than 0.7ms−1; and the sum-vector of acceleration of all spatial components higher than 6g. The algorithm was able to discriminate activities of daily living from intentional falls.

	abstract = {Walking in daily life places high demands on the interplay between cognitive and motor functions. A well-functioning dual-tasking ability is thus essential for walking safely. The aims were to study longitudinal changes in gait function during single- and dual-tasking over a period of two years among people with initially mild {AD} (n = 21). Data were collected on three occasions, twelve months apart. An optical motion capture system was used for three-dimensional gait analysis. Gait parameters were examined at comfortable gait speed during single-tasking, dual-tasking naming names, and naming animals. The dual-task cost for gait speed was pronounced at baseline (names 26\%, animals 35\%), and remained so during the study period. A significant (p {\textless} 0.05) longitudinal decline in gait speed and step length during single- and dual-tasking was observed, whereas double support time, step width and step height showed inconsistent results. Systematic visual examination of the motion capture files revealed that dual-tasking frequently resulted in gait disturbances. Three main characteristics of such disturbances were identified: Temporal disturbance, Spatial disturbance and Instability in single stance. These aberrant gait performances may affect gait stability and increase the risk of falling. Furthermore, the observed gait disturbances can contribute to understanding and explaining previous reported gait variability among individuals with {AD}. However, the role that dual-task testing and aberrant dual-task gait performance play in the identification of individuals with early signs of cognitive impairment and in predicting fall risk in {AD} remains to be studied.},

	abstract = {The estimation of human body segment properties ({BSPs}), including mass, centroid and moments of inertia, is required in the kinetic analysis of human motion. Nowadays, with the development of motion capture technology, motion capture data plays an important role in the kinetic analysis of human motion. An interesting problem is whether {BSPs} can be estimated using the motion capture data. It is well known that the motions of human body should obey Newton's laws of mechanics, which means that human {BSPs} and motion data should satisfy the motion equation. Then we build an optimization model according to this principle where the objective function measures the degree of mismatch between motion data, human {BSPs} and Newton's laws of mechanics. By solving this optimization model, we can estimate the human {BSPs}. To deal with this optimization, we adopt three strategies: variables block, adjustment on constraints and stochastic local search. This method has two advantages. First, given motion capture data, {BSPs} can be estimated directly without carrying out additional measurements, such as {CT} imaging. Second, {BSPs} and motion capture data can be analyzed together. Simulation experimental results show that the errors of mass, centroid and moment of inertia can be controlled within 10\%, 5\% and 15\% respectively.},

	abstract = {{RNA}-binding proteins mediate posttranscriptional functions in the circadian systems of multiple species. A conserved {RNA} recognition motif ({RRM}) protein encoded by the lark gene is postulated to serve circadian output and molecular oscillator functions in Drosophila and mammals, respectively. In no species, however, has {LARK} been eliminated, in vivo, to determine the consequences for circadian timing. The present study utilized {RNA} interference ({RNAi}) techniques in Drosophila to decrease {LARK} levels in clock neurons and other cell types in order to evaluate the circadian functions of the protein. Knockdown of {LARK} in timeless ({TIM})- or pigment dispersing factor ({PDF})-containing clock cells caused a significant number of flies to exhibit arrhythmic locomotor activity, demonstrating a requirement for the protein in pacemaker cells. There was no obvious effect on {PER} protein cycling in lark interference ({RNAi}) flies, but a knockdown within the {PDF} neurons was associated with increased {PDF} immunoreactivity at the dorsal termini of the small ventral lateral neuronal (s-{LNv}) projections, suggesting an effect on neuropeptide release. The expression of lark {RNAi} in multiple neurosecretory cell populations demonstrated that {LARK} is required within pacemaker and nonpacemaker cells for the manifestation of normal locomotor activity rhythms. Interestingly, decreased {LARK} function in the prothoracic gland ({PG}), a peripheral organ containing a clock required for the circadian control of eclosion, was associated with weak population eclosion rhythms or arrhythmicity.},

In the proposed {EKF}, the quaternion associated with the body rotation is included in the state vector together with the bias of the aiding system sensors. Moreover, in addition to the in-line procedure of sensor bias compensation, the measurement noise covariance matrix is adapted, to guard against the effects which body motion and temporary magnetic disturbance may have on the reliability of measurements of gravity and earth's magnetic field, respectively. By computer simulations and experimental validation with human hand orientation motion signals, improvements in the accuracy of orientation estimates are demonstrated for the proposed {EKF}, as compared with filter implementations where either the in-line calibration procedure, the adaptive mechanism for weighting the measurements of the aiding system sensors, or both are not implemented.},

The calculation error of 3D posture by gyro sensor increases with the passage of time due to the calculation of time integration. This method can estimate the 3D posture compensating the drift error by the Unscented Kalman filter, and the method can avoid the effect of dynamic acceleration and magnetic disturbance. The 3D posture is represented by quaternion in this method. Therefore, the 3D posture estimated by this method can avoid the effect of singular value problem. In order to indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted the experiment using the experimental setup installing rotary encoders. The results by proposed method approximately corresponded with the results by rotary encoders. The precision of results by proposed method was higher than that of results by gyro sensor, and we estimated the 3D posture in the motion generating singular value problem.

In particular, the research outcome indicated that the creation of the motion picture of golf swing for the beginner comprises of 3 major parts as follows: 1) the motion capture tool setup, suitable and sufficient space for working, camera positioning, and the right number of reflex spots on the actor's body, 2) the golf swing movement capture divided into 3 patterns by the number of the reflex spots and each pattern was done for at least 5 times by golf professionals for the movement capture, and 3) the three 3D characters and motion picture in which the researchers created with similar ratio of real human and applied the captured movement data to construct the animation character skeleton before obtaining three sets of the golf swing animation divided by the number of reflex spots. Surprisingly, the research revealed the golf professionals' suggestion that most of the current movement of golf swing has been performed in improper manners. In this regard, this research suggested that to demonstrate the proper golf swing movement for golf beginner, the key factors was not only the number and position of reflex spots on the actor's body but also the certain regulation in utilizing the motion capture tools, and that the 3D characters, in most cases, should be created with similar ratio of body as a real human.},

This method is based on water saturation shift referencing ({WASSR}), a method first developed for assessing B-0 field inhomogeneity. Temperature-induced water {PRF} shifts were determined by estimating the frequency of the minimum intensity of the water direct saturation spectrum at each temperature using Lorentzian line-shape fitting. The change in temperature was then calculated from the difference in water {PRF} shifts between temperatures. Optimal acquisition parameters were first estimated using simulations and later confirmed experimentally. Results in vitro and in vivo showed that the temperature changes measured using the temperature-responsive {WASSR} (T-{WASSR}) were in good agreement with those obtained with {MR} spectroscopy or phase-mapping-based water {PRF} measurement methods,. In addition, the feasibility of temperature mapping in fat-containing tissue is demonstrated in vitro. In conclusion, the T-{WASSR} approach provides an alternative for non-invasive temperature mapping by {MRI}, especially suitable for temperature measurements in fat-containing tissues.

	title = {Current Technological Advances in Magnetic Resonance With Critical Impact for Clinical Diagnosis and Therapy},
	volume = {48},
	issn = {0020-9996},
	abstract = {The last 5 years of technological advances with major impact on clinical magnetic resonance ({MR}) are discussed, with greater emphasis on those that are most recent. These developments have already had a critical positive effect on clinical diagnosis and therapy and presage continued rapid improvements for the next 5 years. This review begins with a discussion of 2 topics that encompass the breadth of {MR}, in terms of anatomic applications, contrast media, and {MR} angiography. Subsequently, innovations are discussed by anatomic category, picking the areas with the greatest development, starting with the brain, moving forward to the liver and kidney, and concluding with the musculoskeletal system, breast, and prostate. Two final topics are then considered, which will likely, with time, become independent major fields in their own right, interventional {MR} and {MR} positron emission tomography ({PET}). The next decade will bring a new generation of {MR} contrast media, with research focused on substantial improvements (9100-fold) in relaxivity (contrast effect), thus providing greater efficacy, safety, and tissue targeting. Magnetic resonance angiography will see major advances because of the use of compressed sensing, in terms of spatial and temporal resolution, with movement away from nondynamic imaging. The breadth of available techniques and tissue contrast has greatly expanded in brain imaging, benefiting both from the introduction of new basic categories of imaging techniques, such as readout-segmented echo planar imaging and 3D fast spin echo imaging with variable flip angles, and from new refinements specific to anatomic areas, such as double inversion recovery and {MP}2RAGE. Liver imaging has benefited from the development of techniques to easily and rapidly assess lipid, and will see, overall, a marked improvement in the next 5 years from new techniques on the verge of clinical introduction, such as controlled aliasing in parallel imaging results in higher acceleration ({CAIPIRINHA}), with a substantial impact on both spatial resolution and scan time. Renal {MR} is benefiting from the application of blood-oxygen-level-dependent imaging, providing an assessment of renal function critical for the evaluation of chronic kidney disease. Techniques to reduce metal artifact are a major focus of development in musculoskeletal {MR} and are critical for the ever-increasing postsurgical and implant patient population, leading to markedly improved imaging of tissue adjacent to metal and diagnosis of infection, prosthesis loosening, and postsurgical complications such as fracture. In breast {MR}, scan techniques are continuing to evolve, and the impact of this examination on screening for and evaluation and treatment of breast carcinoma is substantial with continued expansion of indications. Prostate {MR} has benefited from multiparametric imaging and the application of diffusion-weighted imaging, the latter technique also now applied more generally in body imaging, with a substantial clinical impact, in particular for the detection of tumor lymph nodes. Interventional {MR} is still early in its development, although well established in many centers, possessing great potential in comparison with computed tomography ({CT}) because of superior soft-tissue contrast, real-time multiplanar imaging guidance and monitoring, the availability of temperature mapping, and the lack of ionizing radiation. And last but not least, {MR}-{PET} is in its infancy, with the first round of clinical units installed in the past 2 years and early clinical experience showing equivalence and, in some instances, superiority to {PET}-{CT}. As with the field of {MR} itself, which began when {CT} was already an established modality, {MR}-{PET} will likely, in the next decade, become an equivalent modality to {PET}-{CT}, if not begin to supplant the latter modality.},

In this feedback filter, only bias effects are considered to be independent states and are used to compensate for navigation errors. To preserve the nonlinear nature of unit quaternion, the weighted mean computation for quaternions is derived in rotational space as a barycentric mean with renormalization and a multiplicative quaternion-error is used for predicted covariance computation of the quaternion because it represents the distance from the predicted mean quaternion. The updates are performed using quaternion multiplication which guarantees that quaternion normalization is maintained in the filter. Since the quaternion process noise increases the uncertainty in attitude orientation, modeling it as a vector part of quaternion is considered. Simulation and experimental results indicate a satisfactory performance of the newly developed model.},

An analysis of the essence of the "oncogene position effect" from this standpoint shows that an integration, similar in its mechanism but differing in polarity, of the genome of other viruses with the cell genome should lead to the formation of a corresponding antiviral stable (life-long) immunity or also to the emergence of pseudoautoimmune disease of the type caused by "slow" viruses.},

Moreover, the proposed observer allows estimating the bias in gyroscope which is used to correct the angular velocity measurements in the attitude estimation step. Since, biologists use an index of {DBA} for evaluating the energy consumption of the moving animal; the resulting estimations are then used to extract the Dynamic Body Acceleration ({DBA}) of the animal. Note that, this work is necessary in Bio-logging science and allows monitoring aspects of animal's biology (behavior, movement, and physiology) and environments. The performance of the algorithm is theoretically proven and illustrated by an attitude estimation example. Moreover, the efficiency of the proposed approach is shown with a set of experiments through sensor measurements provided by an Inertial Measurement Unit ({IMU}).

{ABSTRACT}

Presented by David Sachs.

Gyroscopes, accelerometers, and compasses are increasingly prevalent in mainstream consumer electronics. Applications of these sensors include user interface, augmented reality, gaming, image stabilization, and navigation. This talk will demonstrate how all three sensor types work separately and in conjunction on a modified Android handset running a modified sensor {API}, then explain how algorithms are used to enable a multitude of applications.

Application developers who wish to make sense of rotational motion must master Euler angles, rotation matrices, and quaternions. Under the hood, sensor fusion algorithms must be used in order to create responsive, accurate, and low noise descriptions of motion. Reducing sensing errors involves compensating for temperature changes, magnetic disturbances, and sharp accelerations. Some of these algorithms must run at a very high rate and with very precise timing, which makes them difficult to implement within low-power real-time operating systems. Within Android specifically, this involves modifying the sensor manager, introducing new {APIs}, and partitioning motion processing tasks. 

David Sachs began developing motion processing systems as a graduate student at the {MIT} Media Lab. His research there led him to {InvenSense}, where he continues this work with {MEMS} inertial sensors used in products such as the Nintendo Wii Motion Plus. David's designs incorporate gyroscopes, accelerometers, and compasses in various combinations and contexts including handset user interfaces, image stabilizers, navigation systems, game controllers, novel Braille displays, and musical instruments.},

	abstract = {We present a non-invasive {MRI} approach for assessing the water proton resonance frequency ({PRF}) shifts associated with changes in temperature. This method is based on water saturation shift referencing ({WASSR}), a method first developed for assessing B0 field inhomogeneity. Temperature-induced water {PRF} shifts were determined by estimating the frequency of the minimum intensity of the water direct saturation spectrum at each temperature using Lorentzian line-shape fitting. The change in temperature was then calculated from the difference in water {PRF} shifts between temperatures. Optimal acquisition parameters were first estimated using simulations and later confirmed experimentally. Results in vitro and in vivo showed that the temperature changes measured using the temperature-responsive {WASSR} (T-{WASSR}) were in good agreement with those obtained with {MR} spectroscopy or phase-mapping-based water {PRF} measurement methods,. In addition, the feasibility of temperature mapping in fat-containing tissue is demonstrated in vitro. In conclusion, the T-{WASSR} approach provides an alternative for non-invasive temperature mapping by {MRI}, especially suitable for temperature measurements in fat-containing tissues.

	abstract = {Fitness development and performance assessment of elite athletes requires an understanding of many physiological factors, many of these are direct and indirect measures of athlete energy expenditure. Many methods are physiological factor assessments and require the athlete to be constrained by laboratory equipment or periodic interruption of activity to take measurements such as blood samples are required to be taken. This paper presents a method that is entirely ambulatory and noninvasive, using microelectromechanical systems ({MEMS}) accelerometers. The commonly used output of commercial accelerometer-based devices (known as "counts") cannot discriminate activity intensity for the activities of interest. This, in conjunction with variability in output from different systems and lack of commonality across manufacturers, limits the usefulness of commercial devices. This paper identifies anthropometric and kinematic sources of inter-athlete variability in accelerometer output, leading to an alternate energy expenditure estimator based mainly on step frequency modified by anthropometric measures. This energy expenditure estimator is more robust and not influenced by many sources of variability that affect the currently used estimator. In this system, low-power signal processing was implemented to extract both the energy estimator and other information of physiological and statistical interest},

We then inserted the {SWA} in a metabolic jacket for baboons and evaluated the {TEE} and {REE} in free living condition for 6 days in 21 (8F/13M) non-human primates.; Results: In humans we found a good correlation between {SWA} place on the {ARM} and on the {BACK} with {IC} during the resting experiment (1.1±0.3 {SWAs}, 1±0.2 {IC} kcal/min) and a slight underestimation in the {SWAs} data compared with {IC} during the cycle-ergometer exercise (5±1.9 {SWA} {ARM}, 4.5±1.5 {SWA} {BACK} and 5.4±2.1 {IC} kcal/min). In the non-human primate (baboons) experiment {SWA} estimated a {TEE} of 0.54±0.009 kcal/min during free living and a {REE} of 0.82±0.06 kcal/min.; Conclusion: {SWA}, an extremely simple and inexpensive apparatus, provides quite accurate measurements of energy expenditure in humans and in baboons. Energy expenditure data obtained with {SWA} are highly correlated with the data obtained with "gold standard", {IC}, in humans.;},

Typical physical-activity characterization using commercial monitors use proprietary counts that do not have a physically interpretable meaning. This paper emphasizes the role of probabilistic techniques in conjunction with inertial data modeling to accurately predict energy expenditure for steady-state treadmill walking. We represent the cyclic nature of walking with a Fourier transform and show how to map this representation to energy expenditure ([(V)dot]O2, {mL}/min) using three regression techniques. A comparative analysis of the accuracy of sensor streams in predicting energy expenditure reveals that using triaxial information leads to more accurate energy-expenditure prediction compared to only using one axis. Combining accelerometer and gyroscope information leads to improved accuracy compared to using either sensor alone. Nonlinear regression methods showed better prediction accuracy compared to linear methods but required an order of higher magnitude run time.},

Clinically, the time taken to complete the task is recorded with longer times indicating increased falls risk. Quantifying the movement using tri-axial accelerometers may provide a more objective and potentially more accurate falls risk estimate. 39 older adults, 19 with a history of falls, performed four repetitions of the {FTSS} in their homes. A tri-axial accelerometer was attached to the lateral thigh and used to identify each sit–stand–sit phase and sit–stand and stand–sit transitions. A second tri-axial accelerometer, attached to the sternum, captured torso acceleration. The mean and variation of the root-mean-squared amplitude, jerk and spectral edge frequency of the acceleration during each section of the assessment were examined. The test–retest reliability of each feature was examined using intra-class correlation analysis, {ICC}(2,k). A model was developed to classify participants according to falls status. Only features with {ICC} {\textgreater} 0.7 were considered during feature selection. Sequential forward feature selection within leave-one-out cross-validation resulted in a model including four reliable accelerometer-derived features, providing 74.4\% classification accuracy, 80.0\% specificity and 68.7\% sensitivity. An alternative model using {FTSS} time alone resulted in significantly reduced classification performance.

	abstract = {In most cases, a gimbaled inertial measurement unit ({IMU}) can provide more accurate navigation information than a strap-down {IMU} when there is no navigation aiding of global positioning system ({GPS}) or other equipments. The gimbaled {IMU} is still used in self-contained precision navigation systems such as launch vehicles, missiles and vessels.
To guarantee precision navigation, it is necessary to carry out in-field calibration for the gimbaled {IMU} before a mission. It is not fit to adopt multi-position calibration method to calibrate the gimbaled {IMU} mounted on a carrier on the sea because the signal to noise ratio ({SNR}) of gyro and accelerometer is low when the gimbals are locked. Traditional continuous calibration methods which use measured acceleration to calibrate gyros and accelerometers are not fit either because of the lever-arm errors caused by the vessel’s attitude motion.
Focusing on the problem above, this paper proposes a new calibration scheme. The gyro parameters are calibrated separately through measured gimbal angles and the accelerometer parameters are calibrated by a “shape-from-motion” method without attitude information.
Keeping the gimbals unlocked and rotating the gimbals continuously, the measured gimbal angles can be used to calibrate gyro parameters and case misalignments as the {IMU} is mounted on a gyro-stabilized platform. Because the gyro errors and case misalignments propagate nonlinearly in gimbal angles error model, a nonlinear estimation filer, spherical simplex unscented Kalman filter ({SSUKF}), is adopted to deal with this problem. Besides, the parameters’ observability is analyzed by the singular value analysis of the observability matrix and the theory of relative output sensitivity and a continuous calibration scheme is established. Simulation for the proposed calibration scheme is conducted and the sensitivity to environment disturbances is analyzed. It is shown that the proposed method can calibrate onboard gimbaled {IMU} with high precision and proves practical in dealing with environment disturbances.},

This energy can be used to elevate the tissue temperature to such a degree that ablation is achieved.

Lower dose exposures modify the vasculature to allow large molecules to diffuse from blood in the surrounding tissue for local drug delivery. The energy delivery can be targeted and monitored using magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}). The online image guidance and monitoring provides treatment delivery that is customized to each patient such that optimal, effective treatment can be achieved. This ability to localize and customize treatment delivery may further enhance the future potential of targeted drugs that are personalized for each patient.

	doi = {10.1109/ICMLA.2008.131},
	abstract = {This article presents an approach to estimating exercise energy expenditure based on acceleration measurements from a wrist-worn biaxial sensor. The method uses the linear mixed model that makes it possible to model both between-subject and within-subject variation in energy expenditure. More precisely, a random-intercepts model is used. The variance and mean of the acceleration signals at 15-second intervals as well as subject demographics (height, weight, body mass index, age and {VO}2max) are used. Energy expenditure is modelled in four different activities: walking, running, Nordic walking and bicycling. This study introduces an effective backward model selection procedure for selecting the fixed-effect variables in the model. The procedure uses leave-one-out cross-validation to be able to effectively exploit the available data set and to ensure the robustness of the model. Estimation accuracy in test sets is used as a criterion of model performance. The model selection procedure proposed notably improves estimation accuracy. In walking, running, Nordic walking and bicycling, average estimation errors of 3.9, 3.6, 1.9 and 13.5 percent are reached. The respective Person correlations for these activities are 0.91, 0.98, 0.97, and 0.81. These results are also compared to the performance of the general linear model. It is discovered that the linear mixed model outperforms the model that does not take the individual levels of energy expenditure of the subjects into account.},

After uploading the accelerometer data to the manufacturer's website, a report was received that gave minute-by-minute {MI} and {EE} of the performed activities. Validity was assessed by comparing reported activities and {EE} with the actual performed activities and calculated {EE} from the oxygen uptake, and by testing whether {MI} differed between walking velocities and cycling resistances. Reliability was assessed by performing the protocol twice. Except for standing (classified predominantly (82\%) as sitting), most activities were categorized mainly correctly (93–100\%). A difference in {MI} was detected between walking speeds but not between cycling resistances. {EE} was overestimated for walking ({ICC} = 0.54) and underestimated for cycling ({ICC} = 0.03). Reliability of {MI} was high ({ICC} = 0.91) but reliability for the relative time spent in activities or the step count was weak to moderate. In conclusion, most activities were categorized correctly, {MI} seemed to be valid and reliable but reliability is low for relative time spent in activities and {EE} cannot be estimated well.},

A wide array of different approaches have been investigated using various technologies including inertial sensors, Global Positioning System, smart homes, Radio Frequency {IDentification} and others. It is only in recent years that research has turned towards a sensor fusion approach using several different technologies in single systems or devices. These systems allow for an increased volume of data to be collected and for activity data to be better used as measures of behaviour. This change may be due to decreasing hardware costs, smaller sensors, increased power efficiency or increases in portability. This paper is intended to act as a reference for the design of multi-sensor behaviour monitoring systems. The range of technologies that have been used in isolation for behaviour monitoring both in research and commercial devices are reviewed and discussed. Filtering, range, sensitivity, usability and other considerations of different technologies are discussed. A brief overview of commercially available activity monitors and their technology is also included.},

	abstract = {This work presents an orientation tracking system based on a double stage Kalman filter for sensor fusion in 9D {IMU}. The {IMU} is composed by a 3D gyro, a 3D accelerometer and a magnetic compass. The filter was divided into two stages to reduce algorithm complexity. Gyro data are used to first estimate the angular position, then the first stage corrects roll and pitch angles using accelerometer data. The second stage processes magnetic compass data to correct the yaw angle. One of the advantages of this kind of filter is that a magnetic anomaly does not influence roll and pitch estimation accuracy. The flexibility is also desirable, because if the magnetic compass is not available, it is simply possible to switch off the second stage of the filter. In this work an {ASIP} was designed to process the filter algorithm and a proof of concept on {FPGA} was successfully realized. In the future the {ASIP} will be integrated within the logic of a new 6D sensor that could be optionally interfaced with an external magnetic compass.},

{METHODS}: The physics and measurement principles of the accelerometer are described, including the sensor properties, data collections, filtering, and integration analyses. The paper also compares these properties in several commonly used single-site accelerometers. The emerging accelerometry technologies introduced include the multisensor arrays and the combination of accelerometers with physiological sensors. The outputs of accelerometers are compared with criterion measures of energy expenditure (indirect calorimeters and double-labeled water) to develop mathematical models (linear, nonlinear, and variability approaches).
{RESULTS}: The technologies of the sensor and data processing directly influence the results of the outcome measurement (activity counts and energy expenditure predictions). Multisite assessment and combining accelerometers with physiological measures may offer additional advantages. Nonlinear approaches to predict energy expenditure using accelerometer outputs from multiple sites and orientation can enhance accuracy.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The development of portable accelerometers has made objective assessments of physical activity possible. Future technological improvements will include examining raw acceleration signals and developing advanced models for accurate energy expenditure predictions.},

The existing human motion capture techniques, which use structured multiple high resolution cameras in the dedicated studio, are complicated and expensive. As rapid development of micro inertial sensors-on-chip, ubiquitous, real-time, and low cost human motion capture system using micro-inertial-sensors ({MMocap}) becomes possible. This paper presents a novel motion estimation algorithm by hierarchical fusion of sensor data and constraints of human dynamic model for human upper limb motion capture. Our method represents orientations of upper limb segments in quaternion, which is computationally effective and able to avoid singularity problem. To address the nonlinear human body segment motion, a particle filter is proposed to fuse 3D accelerometer and 3D micro-gyroscope sensor data to estimate upper limb motion recursively. Drift is the most challenging issue in motion estimation using inertial sensors. We present a novel solution by modeling the geometrical constraints in elbow joint and fuse these constraints to the particle filter process to compensate drift and improve the estimation accuracy. The experimental results have shown the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed motion capture and analysis algorithm.},

The implemented system was evaluated through experiments on controlling bars and avoiding obstacles using three subjects. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the feedback training method was evaluated by comparison with an imaginary movement experiment without any visual feedback for two additional subjects. In the bar-controlling experiment, two subjects achieved a 95.00\% success rate, and the third had a 91.66\% success rate. In the obstacle avoidance experiment, all three achieved success rate over 90\% success rate, and required almost the same amount of time to reach as that when driving with a joystick.

In this feedback filter, only the bias effects are considered to be independent states and are used to compensate for navigation errors. To preserve the nonlinear nature of the unit quaternion, the weighted mean computation for quaternions is derived in rotational space as a barycentric mean with renormalization and a multiplicative quaternion-error is used for predicted covariance computation of the quaternion because it represents the distance from the predicted mean quaternion. The updates are performed using quaternion multiplication which guarantees that quaternion normalization is maintained in the filter. Since the quaternion process noise increases the uncertainty in attitude orientation, modeling it as a rotation vector is considered. Simulation and experimental results indicate a satisfactory performance of the newly developed model.},

	abstract = {Automated recognition of human daily activities from wearable sensor signals has attracted a great deal of interests in many applications including health care, sports and aged care. In this paper, we presented a Hidden Markov Model ({HMM})-based recognition method to recognize six human daily activities from sensor signals collected from a single waist-worn tri-axial accelerometer. All training signals from the same activity class are modeled as generated by a {HMM}, while a Gaussian Mixture Model ({GMM}) is used to model the continuous observation for each hidden state. A new test signal is classified to the activity class corresponding to the {HMM} that can produce the highest likelihood. In order to validate the performance of the proposed method, we collected 420 samples from seven subjects and 72 samples from six new subjects, while performing six daily activities including walking, standing, running, jumping, sitting-down, and falling-down. Two batches of experiments were conducted. The experimental results on the first dataset show that the proposed {HMM} classifier can learn acceleration signals well with low computational complexity, achieving a very high activity recognition accuracy of 94.8\%. In the second experiment, the {HMM} classifier was evaluated by using new data contained in the second dataset and only two samples were misclassified, which demonstrates that the {HMM}-based recognition system has a good generalization capability. It can be concluded that the proposed method holds a potential in long-term in-situ assessment of human daily activities under ambulatory environment due to its robustness and computational simplicity.},

Under situations where global positioning system ({GPS}) and inertial navigation system ({INS}) do not function, or as an additional sensor, computer vision can be used. Having 360° view, catadioptric cameras might be very useful as they can be used as measurement units, obstacle avoidance sensors or navigation planners. Although many innovative research has been done about this camera, employment of such cameras in {UAVs} is very new. In this paper, we present the use of catadioptric systems in {UAVs} to estimate vehicle attitude using parallel lines that exist on many structures in an urban environment. After explanation of the algorithm, the {UAV} modeling and control will be presented. In order to increase the estimation and control speed an Extended Kalman Filter ({EKF}) and multi-threading are used and speeds up to 40 fps are obtained. Various simulations have been done to present the effectiveness of the estimation algorithms as well as the {UAV} controllers. A custom test stand has been designed to perform successful experiments on the {UAV}. Finally, we will present the experiments and the results of the estimation and control algorithms on a real model helicopter. {EKF} based attitude estimation and stabilization using catadioptric images has found to be a reliable alternative to other sensor usage.},

	abstract = {Three dimensional measurements of gait is a widely used tool in clinical gait analysis, and the evaluation of the reliability and reproducibility of the method is a recurring topic in the literature. The reliability of gait curve measurements is often assessed by extraction of single points from the gait curves before applying traditional reliability measures for scalars. This approach does, however, not explore the entire gait curves as continuous functions of time. In order to assess agreement between gait curves measured by different measurement methods, or measurers, we propose an extension of the concept of limits of agreement ({LoA}) to curve data. The {LoA} represent the estimated variation in the actual observations, which are then to be accompanied by an evaluation of whether this observed variation is within clinically acceptable limits. The generalization of the methodology from scalars to continuous function, e.g. gait curves, can be done using functional data analysis ({FDA}), a statistical methodology particularly developed for analyzing functional data. The resulting functional limits of agreement ({FLoA}) are continuous functions from 0 to 100\% of the gait cycle, representing the difference in gait curves as measured by different measurement methods. The {FLoA} are presented in actual degrees for each joint and plane under study. The proposed methodology is demonstrated on real data from an inter-rater repeatability study.},

Body-worn sensors are needed to improve the understanding of the underlying mechanisms and kinematics of falls. The aim of this systematic review is to assemble, extract and critically discuss the information available in published studies, as well as the characteristics of these investigations (fall documentation and technical characteristics). Methods The searching of publically accessible electronic literature databases for articles on fall detection with body-worn sensors identified a collection of 96 records (33 journal articles, 60 conference proceedings and 3 project reports) published between 1998 and 2012. These publications were analysed by two independent expert reviewers. Information was extracted into a custom-built data form and processed using {SPSS} ({SPSS} Inc., Chicago, {IL}, {USA}). Results The main findings were the lack of agreement between the methodology and documentation protocols (study, fall reporting and technical characteristics) used in the studies, as well as a substantial lack of real-world fall recordings. A methodological pitfall identified in most articles was the lack of an established fall definition. The types of sensors and their technical specifications varied considerably between studies. Conclusion Limited methodological agreement between sensor-based fall detection studies using body-worn sensors was identified. Published evidence-based support for commercially available fall detection devices is still lacking. A worldwide research group consensus is needed to address fundamental issues such as incident verification, the establishment of guidelines for fall reporting and the development of a common fall definition.},

	abstract = {In {EMG} hand movement recognition, the first and the most important step is feature extraction. The optimal feature is important for the achievement in {EMG} analysis and control. In this paper, we present a statistical criterion method using the ratio between Euclidean distance and standard deviation, which can response the distance between two scatter groups and directly address the variation of feature in the same group as a selection tool to find the optimal {EMG} feature. Fifteen features that have been widely used to classify {EMG} signals were used. The optimal feature is conducted to demonstrate the validity of the proposed index. The major advantages of this method are simplicities of implementation and computation. Moreover, the results of proposed method are the same trend with classification results of the achievement classifiers in {EMG} recognition. From the experimental results, waveform length is the best feature comparing with the other features. Root mean square, mean absolute value, Willison amplitude, and integrated {EMG} are useful augmenting features for a more powerful feature vector. From these results, it demonstrates that the proposed method can be used for an {EMG} feature evaluation index.},

Potential aerospace applications for this technology include gesture-based crew-autonomy interfaces, high degree of freedom robot teleoperation, and astronauts' control of power-assisted gloves during extra-vehicular activity ({EVA}). We have developed techniques to interpret both static (stationary) and dynamic (time-varying) gestures from the {BioSleeve} signals, enabling a diverse and adaptable command library. For static gestures, we achieved over 96\% accuracy on 17 gestures and nearly 100\% accuracy on 11 gestures, based solely on {EMG} signals. Nine dynamic gestures were decoded with an accuracy of 99\%. This combination of {wearableEMGand} {IMU} hardware and accurate algorithms for decoding both static and dynamic gestures thus shows promise for natural user interface applications.},

Given an articulated template model and silhouettes from a multi-view image sequence, our approach recovers not only the movement of the skeleton, but also the possibly non-rigid temporal deformation of the 3D surface. While large scale deformations or fast movements are captured by the skeleton pose and approximate surface skinning, true small scale deformations or are captured by fitting the surface to the silhouette. We further propose a novel optimization scheme for skeleton-based pose estimation that exploits the skeleton's tree struct ure to split the optimization problem into a local one and a lower dimensional global one. We show on various sequences that our approach can capture the 3D motion of animals and humans accurately even in the case of rapid movements and wide apparel.},

	abstract = {Objectives
There is a need to measure quality of movement to assess effectiveness of physical therapy interventions after stroke. Knee angular velocity may be a sensitive measure of change in performance of movement during functional activity, but not all clinical centres have access to a movement analysis laboratory. The aim of this study was to investigate the concurrent validity of using an electrogoniometer and a laboratory-based movement analysis system (Vicon Motion Systems Ltd, Oxford, {UK}) to measure knee angular velocity.
Design
Prospective agreement study.
Setting
Movement analysis laboratory.
Participants
Fifteen adult volunteers (mean age 55.6 years) at least 6 months after stroke and able to walk at least 4.5 m indoors.
Interventions
Kinematic data were collected simultaneously from the electrogoniometer and the Vicon system whist subjects walked forwards in the laboratory.
Main outcome measures
Electrogoniometer and Vicon data were filtered using a second-order Butterworth filter. Angular velocity was calculated for both sets of data, and the values for peak flexion and peak extension velocity for each stride were extracted for each subject trial.
Results
The intraclass correlation coefficient ({ICC}) and lower 95\% confidence interval was 0.90 (0.87) for peak flexion angular velocity and 0.92 (0.89) for peak extension angular velocity. The limits of agreement were −50.64 to 80.28 °/second for peak flexion angular velocity and −30.59 to 86.27 °/second for peak extension angular velocity.
Conclusions
Despite high {ICC} values, the limits of agreement were wide. These data indicate that the Vicon system and an electrogoniometer may not be used interchangeably to measure knee angular velocity in stroke subjects.},

Its aim is intelligent, environment aware systems unobtrusively embedded into the mobile environments of their users. With the combination of complex processing requirements, the necessity of placing sensors and input/output modules at different locations on the user's body, and stringent limits on size, weight, and battery capacity, the design of such systems is an inherently challenging problem. We demonstrate how systematic design and quantitative analysis can be applied to wearable architectures. We first present a model that allows various factors influencing the design of a wearable system to be incorporated into formal cost metrics. In particular, we show how to consistently incorporate specific wearable factors such as device placement requirements, ergonomics, and dynamic workload profiles into the model. We then discuss how efficient estimation algorithms can be extended and applied to the evaluation of different architectures with respect to our cost metrics. Finally, we discuss quantitative results from a proof-of-concept case study showing the trade offs between different architectures for a given wearable scenario. Summarized, we demonstrate how the description and the design of wearable systems can be put on a systematic, formal basis allowing us to treat them similar as conventional embedded systems.},

In this paper, we present a new approach, which is a framework for collaborative decision making, together with expert feelings about market dynamics to deal with multiple models of stock investment portfolios. The framework aims to aggregate collective expert preferences, including of group expert psychology and sensibility, assists a dynamic trading support system and achieve the greatest investment returns. Kansei evaluation uses to quantify trader sensibilities about trading decisions, market conditions with uncertain risks. Collective group psychology and preference of traders are quantified that represent in membership weights. The framework is used to quantify Kansei, quantitative and qualitative data sets, which are visualized by Self-Organizing Map ({SOM}) in order to select the best alternatives with dynamic solutions for investment. To confirm the model's performance, the proposed approach has been tested and performed well in stock trading for stock investment portfolios. The experiments through case studies show that the new approach, applying Kansei evaluation enhances the capability of investment returns and reduce losses to deal with various financial investment models.},

In this paper, we propose a dual-extended-Kalman-filter- (dual-{EKF}-) based real-time celestial navigation ({RCN}) method. The proposed method considers the rover position and velocity on the lunar surface as the system parameters and establishes a constant velocity ({CV}) model. In addition, the attitude quaternion is considered as the system state, and the quaternion differential equation is established as the state equation, which incorporates the output of angular rate gyroscope. Therefore, the measurement equation can be established with sun direction vector from the sun sensor and speed observation from the speedometer. The gyro continuous output ensures the algorithm real-time operation. Finally, we use the dual-{EKF} method to solve the system equations. Simulation results show that the proposed method can acquire the rover position and heading information in real time and greatly improve the navigation accuracy. Our method overcomes the disadvantage of the cumulative error in inertial navigation.},

Expected from the {MR} protocols are accurate and fast thermal characterizations, providing real time feedback on restricted tissue volumes and/or rapidly moving organs like liver. This article explores the potential advantages of relying on spatiotemporally encoded ({SPEN}) sequences for retrieving real-time thermometric images based on the water’s proton resonance frequency ({PRF}) shifts. Materials and methods Hybrid spatiotemporal/k-space encoding single-scan {MRI} experiments were implemented on animal and human scanners, and their abilities to deliver single- and multi-slice real-time thermometric measurements based on {PRF}-derived phase maps in phantoms and in vivo, were compared against echo planar imaging ({EPI}) and gradient-echo counterparts. Results Under comparable acquisition conditions, {SPEN} exhibited advantages vis-à-vis {EPI} in terms of dealing with inhomogeneous magnetic field distortions, with shifts arising due to changes in the central frequency offsets, with {PRF} distributions, and for zooming into restricted fields-of-view without special pulse sequence provisions. Conclusion This work confirms the ability of {SPEN} sequences, particularly when implemented under fully-refocused conditions, to exploit their built-in robustness to shift- and field-derived inhomogeneities for monitoring thermal changes in real-time under in vitro and in vivo conditions.},

The objective is to elevate the temperature of malignant tissue to a uniform level in excess of some minimum therapeutic temperature (e.g., 42.0 °C) for a period on the order of 30–60 min. At the same time, normal tissue temperatures should be maintained at subtherapeutic levels. This objective is seldom achieved. The difficulty is associated not so much with excessive heating of normal tissue (normal tissue toxicity is thus far reportedly low) as with achieving a minimum, uniform therapeutic temperature in the target tissue volume. It is known that thermal cytotoxicity is very temperature dependent [1]. In addition, thermal tolerance, the ability of cells to become resistant to elevated temperature, is another phenomenon that is highly dependent on temperature and exposure time and may be therapeutically relevant [1,2].},

Atlas’ novel actuation system uses three actuated omni-directional wheels to rotate a spherical capsule that houses the occupant, the cockpit, and the simulator equipment. The unique actuation system allows the spherical capsule to be rotated with a continuously variable angular velocity about a continuously variable axis of rotation. The design process and challenges involved in the development and control of the Atlas simulator are discussed in this paper. To date, an incremental three-phase development approach of the Atlas simulator has resulted in desktop, half-scale, and full-scale prototypes of the simulator. The desktop proof-of-concept model and the focus of this paper, Atlas Lite, is used to test the basics of Atlas’s novel actuation, sensing, and control technologies. This paper introduces the actuation system concept and its implementation on Atlas Lite and a unique vision-based sensing system based on color markers used to estimate the orientation of the spherical capsule. This paper also describes a new nonlinear kinematic controller that allows the spherical capsule to track an arbitrary trajectory. Results from the implementation on Atlas Lite indicate the orientation controller and actuation system allow the spherical capsule to track representative aircraft motions from traditional flight simulation software.},

This study evaluated a variety of existing and novel fall-detection algorithms for a waist-mounted accelerometer based system.

Results show that using an algorithm that employs thresholds in velocity, impact and posture (velocity+impact+posture) achieves 100\% specificity and sensitivity with a false-positive rate of less than 1 false-positive (0.6 false-positives) per day of waking hours. This algorithm is the most suitable method of fall-detection, when tested using continuous unscripted activities performed by elderly healthy volunteers, which is the target environment for a fall-detection device.},

This paper describes in detail how to measure and apply appropriate pointing corrections, so that the instrument's "beam" will be at a specified elevation angle above the horizon. This will be done by describing how these pointing corrections are measured and applied for the Microwave Temperature Profiler ({MTP}), an instrument which must scan to fixed elevation angles from near-zenith to near-nadir.},

	abstract = {Background : Traditional cognitive neuropsychological models are good at diagnosing deficits but are limited when it comes to studying recovery and rehabilitation. Parallel distributed processing ({PDP}) models have more potential in this regard as they are dynamic and can actually learn. However, to date very little work has been done in using {PDP} models to study recovery and rehabilitation. Aims : This study seeks to demonstrate how a {PDP} model of acquired dyslexia can be extended to provide a computational framework that is capable of making predictions about the relative effectiveness of therapeutic interventions. Methods \& Procedures : A replication of Plaut, {McClelland}, Seidenberg, and Patterson's (1996, simulation 2) model of word reading was trained and then damaged. This damaged network was then retrained in a number of different ways designed to model both natural (spontaneous) recovery and recovery that can be attributed to a specific therapeutic intervention. Outcomes \& Results : Interventions that used regular words were more effective than interventions based on inconsistent words. Early intervention (during the period of spontaneous recovery) was more effective than late intervention. Conclusions : These results suggest that this technique has the potential to provide a useful input to the therapeutic arena. The potential opportunities for further work are discussed.},

	abstract = {Humans walk bipedally, and thus, it is unclear why they swing their arms. In this paper, we will review the mechanisms and functions of arm swinging in human gait.
First, we discuss the potential advantages of having swinging arms. Second, we go into the detail on the debate whether arm swing is arising actively or passively, where we will conclude that while a large part of arm swinging is mechanically passive, there is an active contribution of muscles (i.e. an activity that is not merely caused by stretch reflexes). Third, we describe the possible function of the active muscular contribution to arm swinging in normal gait, and discuss the possibility that a Central Pattern Generator ({CPG}) generates this activity. Fourth, we discuss examples from pathological cases, in which arm swinging is affected. Moreover, using the ideas presented, we suggest ways in which arm swing may be used as a therapeutic aid.
We conclude that (1) arm swing should be seen as an integral part of human bipedal gait, arising mostly from passive movements, which are stabilized by active muscle control, which mostly originates from locomotor circuits in the central nervous system (2) arm swinging during normal bipedal gait most likely serves to reduce energy expenditure and (3) arm swinging may be of therapeutic value.},

	abstract = {This chapter provides an overview of {MRI} bioeffects, discusses various {MRI} safety topics and issues, presents evidence-based guidelines to ensure safety for patients and staff members, and describes safety information for implants and devices with an emphasis on neuromodulation systems. Most {MR} systems in use today operate with static magnetic fields ranging from 0.2-Tesla to 3-Tesla. Although there have been some reports of potentially injurious effects of static magnetic fields on isolated cells or organisms, none of these effects has been verified or firmly established as a scientific fact. The quantitative analysis of these mechanisms indicates that they are below the threshold of significance with respect to long-term adverse bioeffects. During {MRI} procedures, gradient or “time-varying” magnetic fields may stimulate nerves or muscles by inducing electrical fields in patients. However, the current safety standards for gradient magnetic fields associated with present-day scanners appear to adequately protect patients from potential hazards or injuries. The establishment of thorough and effective screening procedures for patients and other individuals is one of the most critical components of a program that guards the safety of all those preparing to undergo {MRI} procedures or to enter the {MRI} environment. An important aspect of protecting patients and individuals from {MR} system-related accidents and injuries involves an understanding of the risks associated with the various implants, devices, accessories, and other objects that may cause problems in this setting. Certain aspects of screening patients for {MRI} examinations may take place during the scheduling process, which must be conducted by a healthcare professional specially trained in {MRI} safety.},

Current methods for ambulatory measurement of body orientation have limited accuracy when the body moves. The aim of the paper was to develop and validate a method for accurate measurement of the orientation of human body segments using an inertial measurement unit ({IMU}). An {IMU} containing three single-axis accelerometers and three single-axis micromachined gyroscopes was assembled in a rectangular box, sized 20×20×30 mm. The presented orientation estimation algorithm continuously corrected orientation estimates obtained by mathematical integration of the 3D angular velocity measured using the gyroscopes. The correction was performed using an inclination estimate continuously obtained using the signal of the 3D accelerometer. This reduces the integration drift that originates from errors in the angular velocity signal. In addition, the gyroscope offset was continuously recalibrated. The method was realised using a Kalman filter that took into account the spectra of the signals involved as well as a fluctuating gyroscope offset. The method was tested for movements of the pelvis, trunk and forearm. Although the problem of integration drift around the global vertical continuously increased in the order of 0.5°s −1, the inclination estimate was accurate within 3° {RMS}. It was shown that the gyroscope offset could be estimated continuously during a trial. Using an initial offset error of 1 rads −1, after 2 min the offset error was roughly 5\% of the original offset error. Using the Kalman filter described, an accurate and robust system for ambulatory motion recording can be realised.},

	abstract = {Continuous thermometry during a hyperthermic procedure may help to correct for local differences in heat conduction and energy absorption, and thus allow optimization of the thermal therapy. Noninvasive, three-dimensional mapping of temperature changes is feasible with magnetic resonance ({MR}) and may be based on the relaxation time T1, the diffusion coefficient (D), or proton resonance frequency ({PRF}) of tissue water. The use of temperature-sensitive contrast agents and proton spectroscopic imaging can provide absolute temperature measurements. The principles and performance of these methods are reviewed in this paper. The excellent linearity and near-independence with respect to tissue type, together with good temperature sensitivity, make {PRF}-based temperature {MRI} the preferred choice for many applications at mid to high field strength (≥ 1 T). The {PRF} methods employ radiofrequency spoiled gradient-echo imaging methods. A standard deviation of less than 1°C, for a temporal resolution below 1 second and a spatial resolution of about 2 mm, is feasible for a single slice for immobile tissues. Corrections should be made for temperature-induced susceptibility effects in the {PRF} method. If spin-echo methods are preferred, for example when field homogeneity is poor due to small ferromagnetic parts in the needle, the D- and T1-based methods may give better results. The sensitivity of the D method is higher that that of the T1 methods provided that motion artifacts are avoided and the trace of D is evaluated. Fat suppression is necessary for most tissues when T1, D, or {PRF} methods are employed. The latter three methods require excellent registration to correct for displacements between scans. J. Magn.

Despite the promising application of inertial measurement unit ({IMU}) for quantification of the energy expenditure during human on-land activities, it has never been deployed before to calculate the aquatic activities energy expenditure. Wearable {IMUs} were used in this paper to capture biomechanically interpretable descriptors of swimming. These descriptors were fed as inputs to a Bayesian linear model for estimation of the energy expenditure. To enhance generalization capacity of the estimator, a non-linear adjustment of the Bayesian model was devised using swimmer's anthropometric parameters. We used a set of four waterproofed {IMUs} worn on forearms, sacrum, and right shank of eighteen swimmers to extract the main spatiotemporal determinants of the front-crawl energy expenditure. The swimmers performed three 300-m trials at 70\%, 80\%, and 90\% of their 400-m personal best time. At the end of each 300 m, the reference value of energy expenditure was measured based on indirect calorimetry and blood lactate concentration. The assessment of the proposed model on the test data shows a strong association between the estimated and reference energy expenditure (Spearman's rho=0.93, ) and a high relative precision of 9.4\%. The backward elimination of model parameters with minimum rms error criterion shows that by excluding the features extracted from forearm sensors, i.e., using only two {IMUs}, we can still achieve an error of 0.9±11.3\%.},

This special type of multivariate time series data is relevant in many research fields including medicine, sports and animation. Key tasks in working with motion data include analysis of motion states and transitions, and synthesis of motion vectors by interpolation and combination. In the practice of research and application of human motion data, challenges exist in providing visual summaries and drill-down functionality for handling large motion data collections. We find that this domain can benefit from appropriate visual retrieval and analysis support to handle these tasks in presence of large motion data. To address this need, we developed {MotionExplorer} together with domain experts as an exploratory search system based on interactive aggregation and visualization of motion states as a basis for data navigation, exploration, and search. Based on an overview-first type visualization, users are able to search for interesting sub-sequences of motion based on a query-by-example metaphor, and explore search results by details on demand. We developed {MotionExplorer} in close collaboration with the targeted users who are researchers working on human motion synthesis and analysis, including a summative field study. Additionally, we conducted a laboratory design study to substantially improve {MotionExplorer} towards an intuitive, usable and robust design. {MotionExplorer} enables the search in human motion capture data with only a few mouse clicks.

For practical exercises, since some students are injured in accidental falls, protecting their health and safety is of utmost importance. After investigating the current standard operating procedure ({SOP}) regarding accident management and common information techniques (e.g., object tracking, vision monitoring, geographic information), this study recognized a major problem. Unclear on-site status during fall accidents affects faculty advisors to respond to emergency situations. Therefore, this study constructed a safety practicum information system. The applied accelerometer determination-based mechanism automatically monitored the behavior of on-site students via mobile phones. For occurring accidental falls, the used image recognition-based mechanism visually highlighted the falling students through surveillance facilities. Relying on the test results in a surveying practicum, this study indicated that the safety practicum information system actively informed faculty advisors of accidental falls and clearly detailed on-site status (i.e., accident sites and falling students).

Additionally, the sensor compensation algorithm exploits the wheel speed data and the steering angle information, since they are already available in most of the modern mass production vehicles. These inputs are combined with the inverse vehicle kinematics to estimate the steady state offset error of each sensor inputs as it is done in a disturbance observer, and the raw sensor measurements are compensated by the estimated offset errors. The stability of the error dynamics regarding the integrated signal processing system is verified, and finally, the performance of the system is tested via experiments based on a real production {SUV}.},

In addition we use this setup to evaluate six of the most commonly available accelerometers today and list their outcomes for linearity, power consumption and correlation of the tested sensors.

	abstract = {Recently, many low-cost micro electro mechanical systems ({MEMS}) {IMUs} have emerged for only several hundred {US} dollars. In comparison to high-end {IMUs}, an entire Inertial Navigation System ({INS}) can be implemented with smaller size/volume, lower weight and costs. On the other hand, they have a relatively lower accuracy due to their larger systematic errors, such as bias, scale factor and drift, which highly depend on disturbance and temperature. Consequently, the original signal output of low-cost {IMU} must be processed to reconstruct smooth attitude estimation. For the application of mobile robot navigation, the algorithms need to be run on embedded processors with low memory and processing resources. This paper analyses various error sources in the attitude measurement for Mobile Robot using low-cost {MEMS}-{IMU} and discusses how to improve measurement accuracy by minimizing the errors and optimizing fusion algorithms. It presents the following aspects: investigating a cheap open source {MEMS}-{IMU}, enhancing {ADC} resolution by oversampling and averaging, filtering the noise caused by vibration, improving attitude estimation using sensor fusing.},

	abstract = {{RNA}-binding proteins mediate posttranscriptional functions in the circadian systems of multiple species. A conserved {RNA} recognition motif ({RRM}) protein encoded by the lark gene is postulated to serve circadian output and molecular oscillator functions in Drosophila and mammals, respectively. In no species, however, has {LARK} been eliminated, in vivo, to determine the consequences for circadian timing. The present study utilized {RNA} interference ({RNAi}) techniques in Drosophila to decrease {LARK} levels in clock neurons and other cell types in order to evaluate the circadian functions of the protein. Knockdown of {LARK} in timeless ({TIM})- or pigment dispersing factor ({PDF})-containing clock cells caused a significant number of flies to exhibit arrhythmic locomotor activity, demonstrating a requirement for the protein in pacemaker cells. There was no obvious effect on {PER} protein cycling in lark interference ({RNAi}) flies, but a knockdown within the {PDF} neurons was associated with increased {PDF} immunoreactivity at the dorsal termini of the small ventral lateral neuronal (s-{LNv}) projections, suggesting an effect on neuropeptide release. The expression of lark {RNAi} in multiple neurosecretory cell populations demonstrated that {LARK} is required within pacemaker and nonpacemaker cells for the manifestation of normal locomotor activity rhythms. Interestingly, decreased {LARK} function in the prothoracic gland ({PG}), a peripheral organ containing a clock required for the circadian control of eclosion, was associated with weak population eclosion rhythms or arrhythmicity.},

Instead of using magnetic sensor data directly in the measurement equation, the data are modified so that the magnetic sensor data almost do not affect pitch and roll estimation during the measurement update. The proposed algorithms can be used for an application, where pitch and roll estimation is critical and there are large magnetic disturbances. Through an experiment and simulations, the proposed algorithms are compared with the standard method that uses magnetic sensor data for pitch and roll estimation. Using 50 simulation data, it is shown that pitch and roll estimation errors are significantly smaller when there are magnetic disturbances.},

This paper presents a quaternion-based orientation optimizer for tracking human body motion, using triaxis rate gyro, accelerometer, and magnetometer signals. The proposed optimizer uses a Gauss-Newton (G-N) method for finding the best-fit quaternion. In order to decrease the computing time, the optimizer is formulated using a virtual rotation concept that allows very fast quaternion updates compared to the conventional G-N method. In addition, to guard against the effects of fast body motions and temporary ferromagnetic disturbances, a situational measurement vector selection procedure is adopted in conjunction with the G-N optimizer. The accuracy of orientation estimates is validated experimentally, using arm motion trials.},

	abstract = {Local thermal therapies are increasingly used in the clinic for tissue ablation. During energy deposition, the actual tissue temperature is difficult to estimate since physiological processes may modify local heat conduction and energy absorption. Blood flow may increase during temperature increase and thus change heat conduction. In order to improve the therapeutic efficiency and the safety of the intervention, mapping of temperature and thermal dose appear to offer the best strategy to optimize such interventions and to provide therapy endpoints. {MRI} can be used to monitor local temperature changes during thermal therapies. On-line availability of dynamic temperature mapping allows prediction of tissue death during the intervention based on semi-empirical thermal dose calculations. Much progress has been made recently in {MR} thermometry research, and some applications are appearing in the clinic. In this paper, the principles of {MRI} temperature mapping are described with special emphasis on methods employing the temperature dependency of the water proton resonance frequency. Then, the prospects and requirements for widespread applications of {MR} thermometry in the clinic are evaluated.},
